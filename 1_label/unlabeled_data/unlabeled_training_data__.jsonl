{"text": "Pubalgia is a painful syndrome of the groin which particularly affects young athletes. Although soccer players are the athletes most often affected, they are not alone. Also included in this group are fencers, tennis players and rugbymen. This ailment is associated with varying degrees of lesions of the muscles of the lower frontal abdomen, pubic symphysis and adductor muscles. The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by standard X-rays which can show radiological anomalies of the pubic symphysis in cases of microtraumatic pubic osteo-arthropathy or insertion tendinitis. Scintigraphic anomalies occur earlier than radiological anomalies and return to normal before them; thus allowing confirmation of healing even when the radiographs are still abnormal. Sonogram and MRI can be advantageous in the detection of a lesion of the abdominal muscles or adductor muscles. MRI can also detect a lesion of the pubic symphysis. The principal differential diagnosis is pubic osteitis. Treatment is medical and combines rest, analgesics and anti-inflammatories. Surgery, namely Nesovic's operation, is reserved for those forms resistant to medical treatment, and must be bilateral.", "meta": {"pmid": 8787303}}
{"text": "Dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32 or PPP1R1B) has been of interest in schizophrenia owing to its critical function in integrating dopaminergic and glutaminergic signaling. In a previous study, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a frequent haplotype associated with cognitive and imaging phenotypes that have been linked with schizophrenia, as well as with expression of prefrontal cortical DARPP-32 messenger RNA (mRNA) in a relatively small sample of postmortem brains. In this study, we examined the association of expression of two major DARPP-32 transcripts, full-length (FL-DARPP-32) and truncated (t-DARPP-32), with genetic variants of DARPP-32 in three brain regions receiving dopaminergic input and implicated in schizophrenia (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus and caudate) in a much larger set of postmortem samples from patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and normal controls (>700 subjects). We found that the expression of t-DARPP-32 was increased in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and was strongly associated with genotypes at SNPs (rs879606, rs90974 and rs3764352), as well as the previously identified 7-SNP haplotype related to cognitive functioning. The genetic variants that predicted worse cognitive performance were associated with higher t-DARPP-32 expression. Our results suggest that variation in PPP1R1B affects the abundance of the splice variant t-DARPP-32 mRNA and may reflect potential molecular mechanisms implicated in schizophrenia and affective disorders.", "meta": {"pmid": 23295814}}
{"text": "Human data were searched to determine whether an association of metabolically or drug-induced maternal toxicity with congenital malformations and intrauterine death would be valid for the human species. Intrauterine death was found to occur in association with maternal homeostatic alterations resulting from phenylketonuria and diabetes, and with maternal toxicity from toxemia of pregnancy, leukemia, burns, alcohol, aminopterin, isotretinoin, and possibly trimethadione. A pattern of anomalies found similar (except for minor differences) and thus suggestive of a possible common cause, was observed among anomalies to phenylketonuria, diabetes mellitus, aminopterin, alcohol, warfarin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, trimethadione, valproic acid, and isotretinoin. The pattern usually consisted of deficiencies in pre- and postnatal development, mid-facial hypoplasia, cleft palate, atrial or ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, hypospadias, hernias, and other less frequent anomalies. The pattern is tentatively associated with alterations in maternal physiology resulting from phenylketonuria and diabetes; maternal toxicity of aminopterin, alcohol, and diverse factors co-occurring with warfarin use; and therapeutic doses (generally toxic in adults) of phenytoin, phenobarbital, trimethadione, and valproic acid. Whether these fetal malformations and intrauterine deaths would occur at nonmaterno-toxic levels of the above teratogenic agents, and, consequently, the strength of the associations could not be estimated for lack of data. However, human data seem to provide some, though weak, support and not to contradict the previous assumption formulated from animal studies that maternal toxicity may be causally related to fetal malformations and embryo-fetal mortality.", "meta": {"pmid": 3308323}}
{"text": "The relaxin family peptides, although structurally closely related to insulin, act on a group of four G protein-coupled receptors now known as Relaxin Family Peptide (RXFP) Receptors. The leucine-rich repeat containing RXFP1 and RXFP2 and the small peptide-like RXFP3 and RXFP4 are the physiological targets for relaxin, insulin-like (INSL) peptide 3, relaxin-3 and INSL5, respectively. RXFP1 and RXFP2 have at least two binding sites--a high-affinity site in the leucine-rich repeat region of the ectodomain and a lower-affinity site in an exoloop of the transmembrane region. Although they respond to peptides that are structurally similar, RXFP3 and RXFP4 demonstrate distinct binding properties with relaxin-3 being the only peptide that can recognize these receptors in addition to RXFP1. Activation of RXFP1 or RXFP2 causes increased cAMP and the initial response for both receptors is the resultant of Gs-mediated activation and G(oB)-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. With RXFP1, an additional delayed increase in cAMP involves betagamma subunits released from G(i3). In contrast, RXFP3 and RXFP4 inhibit adenylate cyclase and RXFP3 causes ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Drugs acting at RXFP1 have potential for the treatment of diseases involving tissue fibrosis such as cardiac and renal failure, asthma and scleroderma and may also be useful to facilitate embryo implantation. Activators of RXFP2 may be useful to treat cryptorchidism and infertility and inhibitors have potential as contraceptives. Studies of the distribution and function of RXFP3 suggest that it is a potential target for anti-anxiety and anti-obesity drugs.", "meta": {"pmid": 17293890}}
{"text": "With a combination of RAFT and click chemistry an amphiphilic block copolymer with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (POEGMEMA) as hydrophilic block and poly(propargyl methacrylate) (PMA) as hydrophobic block has been successfully synthesized. To this, 6-azide-6-deoxy-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (N3-\u03b2-CD) was clicked creating a hosting environment for a hydrophobic small molecule platinum pro-drug. Oxoplatin, the oxidized version of cisplatin, has been modified on its axial ligand introducing cholic acid groups through esterification. This modified cisplatin forms a host-guest complex with \u03b2-cyclodextrin that has been characterised via NMR spectroscopy. The host-guest interaction that the drug established with the \u03b2-cyclodextrin grafted copolymer drove the self-assembly into nanoparticles of a diameter of 266 nm able to physical encapsulate the platinum-based drug. In the presence of ascorbic acid, 70% of the pro-drug is released over a period of 24 h. Cytotoxicity assays on ovarian cancer cells show that the polymer carrier improves the cytotoxicity of the platinum pro-drug. The IC50 value decreases from 37.7 \u03bcM with the pro-drug to 20.4 \u03bcM when the pro-drug is encapsulated into the polymer carrier. This is due to the fact that the uptake of the polymer carrier is up to 6 fold higher than the significantly smaller pro-drug by itself.", "meta": {"pmid": 32263178}}
{"text": "Chemoresistance is a major obstacle for successful treatment of cancer. To identify regions of the genome associated with acquired resistance to therapeutic drugs, we conducted molecular cytogenetic analyses of 23 cancer-cell lines, each resistant to either camptothecin, cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16), Adriamycin, or 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, although the parental tumor lines were not. Subtractive comparative genomic hybridization studies revealed regions of gain or loss in DNA-copy numbers that were characteristic of drug-resistant cell lines; i.e., differences from their drug-sensitive parental cell lines. Thirteen ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes [ABCA3, ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCB6, ABCB8, ABCB10, ABCB11, ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCC4, ABCC9, ABCD3, ABCD4, ABCE1, and ABCF2] were amplified among 19 of the resistant cell lines examined. Three genes encoding antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins (BCL2L2, MCL1, and BCL2L10) were also amplified and consequently overexpressed in three of the derivative lines. Down-regulation of BCL2L2 with an antisense oligonucleotide sensitized a VP-16 resistant ovarian-cancer cell line (SKOV3/VP) to VP-16. A decrease in copy numbers of genes encoding deoxycytidine kinase, DNA topoisomerase I, and DNA topoisomerase II alpha reduced their expression levels in one cytosine arabinoside-resistant line, two of three camptothecin-resistant lines, and two of five VP-16-resistant cell lines, respectively. Our results indicated that changes in DNA-copy numbers of the genes mentioned can activate or down-regulate them in drug-resistant cell lines, and that such genomic alterations might be implicated in acquired chemoresistance.", "meta": {"pmid": 14973057}}
{"text": "Osteoclast differentiation is dependent on the activities of receptor activator NF-kB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Given that RANKL plays a critical role in osteoclast formation and bone resorption, any new compounds found to alter its activity would be predicted to have therapeutic potential for disorders associated with bone loss. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur compound with well-documented anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; currently its effects on osteoclast differentiation are unknown. We sought to investigate whether MSM could regulate osteoclastogenesis, and if so, its mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSM on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, together with STAT3's involvement in the expression of osteoclastic gene markers. These experiments were conducted using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) and cell line material, together with analyses that interrogated both protein and mRNA levels, as well as signaling pathway activity. Although MSM was not toxic to osteoclast precursors, MSM markedly inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activity, multinucleated osteoclast formation, and bone resorptive activity. Additionally, the expression of several osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes, including TRAF6, c-Fos, NFATc1, cathepsin K, and OSCAR were suppressed by MSM. MSM mediated suppression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis involved inhibition of ITAM signaling effectors such as PLC\u03b3 and Syk, with a blockade of NF-kB rather than MAPK activity. Furthermore, MSM inhibited RANKL-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 Ser727. Knockdown of STAT3 using shRNAs resulted in reduced RANKL-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 STAT3, and TRAF6 in cells for which depletion of STAT3 was confirmed. Additionally, the expression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic marker genes were significantly decreased by MSM and STAT3 knockdown. Taken together, these results indicate that STAT3 plays a pivotal role in RANKL-induced osteoclast formation, and that MSM can attenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by blocking both NF-kB and STAT3 activity.

{"text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of gemcitabine (GEM) on microRNA-218 (miR-218) expression in human pancreatic cancer cells. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the differences in miR-218 expression between the GEM-sensitive BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells and GEM-resistant PANC-1 cells. The effect of GEM on the expression of miR-218 in PANC-1 cells was also investigated. PANC-1 cells were transfected either with HMGB1 siRNA to knock down the expression of HMGB1 or with the recombinant HMGB1 expression vector (pcDNA3.1-HMGB1) to overexpress HMGB1. The effect of ectopic expression of HMGB1 on the apoptosis of miR-218-transfected and GEM-treated PANC-1 cells was examined by flow cytometric analysis. The miR-218 expression level was lower in GEM-resistant PANC-1 cells compared to GEM-sensitive BxPC-3 cells (P<0.05). The percentage of apoptotic PANC-1 cells was significantly increased in the miR-218 mimic + GEM group compared to the mimic ctrl + GEM group and the normal control group (P<0.01). The HMGB1 expression level was markedly decreased in PANC-1 cells transfected with HMGB1 siRNA but was significantly increased in PANC-1 cells transfected with the recombinant HMGB1 expression vector, pcDNA3.1-HMGB1 (P<0.01).

In the present study, the role of Eph/Ephrin signalling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2011induced intestinal injury was evaluated in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. LPS treatment significantly increased the levels of proinflammatory mediators [monocyte chemoattractant protein\u20111, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin (IL)\u20111\u03b2, IL\u20116, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20111], activated the EphA2\u2011Ephrin A1, protein kinase B (Akt)\u2011nuclear factor (NF)\u2011\u03baB, Src\u2011NF\u2011\u03baB and Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin signalling pathways, and inhibited EphB1\u2011Ephrin B3 signalling in colon tissues, and primary cultured enteric neuronal and glial cells. Notably, EphA2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment or Ephrin\u00a0B3 overexpression could partially alleviate the LPS\u2011induced upregulation of proinflammatory mediators, and Akt\u2011NF\u2011\u03baB, Src\u2011NF\u2011\u03baB and Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin signalling pathways.

{"text": "Acetylcholine is released in the primary visual cortex during visual stimulation and may have a neuromodulatory role in visual processing. The present study uses both behavioral and functional neuroanatomy investigations to examine this role in the rat. In the first set of experiments the cholinergic system was lesioned with 192 immunoglobulin G (IgG) saporin and the visual acuity and performance in a visual water maze task were assessed. The cholinergic lesion did not affect the visual acuity measured pre- and post-lesion but it did reduce the efficiency to learn a novel orientation discrimination task measured post-lesion. In order to better understand the involvement of the cholinergic system in the neuronal activity in the visual cortex c-Fos expression induced by patterned visual stimulation was further investigated. Results obtained following lesion of the cholinergic fibers (192 IgG-saporin or quisqualic acid), muscarinic inhibition (scopolamine), or NMDA receptor inhibition (CPP) were compared with control conditions. Double and triple immunolabeling was used in order to determine the neurochemical nature of the activated cortical cells. The results demonstrated that patterned stimulation elicited a significant increase in c-Fos immunolabeled neurons in layer IV of the contralateral primary visual cortex to the stimulated eye which was completely abolished by cholinergic fibers lesion as well as scopolamine administration. This effect was independent of NMDA receptor transmission. The c-Fos activation was predominantly observed in the glutamatergic spiny stellate cells and less frequently in GABAergic interneurons. Altogether, these results demonstrate a strong involvement of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in the modulation of post-synaptic visual processing, which could be related to cognitive enhancement or attention during visual learning.", "meta": {"pmid": 18515016}}

Serum GH, IGF-I and serum and urinary markers of bone metabolism were measured before and after 4 months of treatment in 27 patients (short-term treatment) and after 12 and 24 months of treatment in 15 patients (long-term treatment). In the short-term, octreotide significantly decreased the levels of serum GH, IGF-I, calcium, osteocalcin, carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase plus urinary excretion of calcium. Short-term treatment significantly increased serum parathormone levels (before treatment 30.1 +/- 9.57 and at 4 months 46.1 +/- 24.98 ng/L, p < 0.001) and urinary excretion of phosphate; urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was unchanged. The same results were observed during long-term treatment, except that there was no significant difference of serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels before and after treatment. Parathormone concentrations were still higher at 24 months compared with those prior to treatment (before treatment 31.9 +/- 9.74 and at 24 months 44.9 +/- 21.18 ng/L, p < 0.05). The changes of most bone markers during octreotide therapy can be explained by the decrease of serum GH and IGF-I concentrations. On the other hand, the rise of parathormone concentrations suggests that octreotide has ulterior and long-standing actions on calcium homeostasis: intestinal malabsorption of calcium due to the octreotide could contribute to this secondary hyperparathyroidism.

{"text": "Fungal infections are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period, particularly among premature neonates. Four classes of antifungal agents are commonly used in the treatment of fungal infections in pediatric patients: polyene macrolides, fluorinated pyrimidines, triazoles, and echinocandins. Due to the paucity of pediatric data, many recommendations for the use of antifungal agents in this population are derived from the experience in adults. The purpose of this article was to review the published data on fungal infections and antifungal agents, with a focus on neonatal patients, and to provide an overview of the differences in antifungal pharmacology in neonates compared with adults. Pharmacokinetic data suggest dosing differences in children versus adult patients with some antifungals, but not all agents have been fully evaluated. The available pharmacokinetic data on the amphotericin B deoxycholate formulation in neonates exhibit considerable variability; nevertheless, the dosage regimen suggested in the neonatal population is similar to that used in adults. More pharmacokinetic information is available on the liposomal and lipid complex preparations of amphotericin B and fluconazole, and it supports their use in neonates; however, the optimal dosage and duration of therapy is difficult to establish. All amphotericin-B formulations, frequently used in combination with flucytosine, are useful for treating disseminated fungal infections and Candida meningitis in neonates. Fluconazole, with potent in vitro activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and almost all Candida spp., has been used in neonates with invasive candidiasis at dosages of 6 mg/kg/day, and for antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk neonates. There are limited data on itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole use in neonates. Caspofungin, which is active against Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., requires higher doses in children relative to adults, and dosing is best accomplished based on body surface area. Micafungin shows a clear trend toward lower levels in the smallest patients. There are no data on the use of other new antifungal drugs (ravuconazole and anidulafungin) in neonates. In summary, the initial data suggest dosage differences in neonates for some antifungal agents, although the newer agents have not been fully tested for optimal administration in these patients.", "meta": {"pmid": 17927303}}

Twenty-four healthy female volunteers were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial. There were no significant differences between measurements of the area under the concentration-time curve of EE up to 24 h after oral contraceptive intake during placebo and ciprofloxacin administration on days 11 and 16 of the cycles, indicating the absence of pharmacokinetic interaction. Similarly, no clinically significant differences in the levels of sex hormone binding globulin were found between the placebo and ciprofloxacin cycles, indicating no major variation in EE levels during ciprofloxacin and placebo treatment. Ten subjects in each of the placebo and ciprofloxacin groups had early-follicular-phase levels of 17-beta estradiol (<184 ng/liter) at one or more points during their cycles, but none had values above the early-follicular-phase range, indicating no significant ovarian activity. In addition, all subjects had progesterone levels of <2 ng/ml, indicating the absence of ovulation.

{"text": "To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hylan G-F 20 as a substitute for existing treatments for pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, other viscosupplementation devices, and/or as an adjunct to conventional therapy. Hylan G-F 20 (brand name Synvisc, which is manufactured by Genzyme) is a high molecular weight derivative of hyaluronan, a component of joint synovial fluid. It acts as a lubricant and shock absorber. It is administered by injection into the joint space to treat pain associated with OA of the knee. Although the injection procedure is an insured service in Ontario, the device, hylan G-F 20, is not. Osteoarthritis is prevalent in 10% to 12% of Ontario adults, and exceeds 40% in Ontario residents aged 65 years and older. About one-half of these people have mild, moderate, or severe OA of the knee. Conventional treatment involves a combination of nonpharmacological management (e.g., weight loss, exercise, social support, and patient education), drugs, (e.g., acetaminophen, COX-2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with/without misoprostol, intra-articular glucocorticoids, opioids, and topical analgesics) and surgical interventions, such as debridement and total knee replacement, when pharmacological management fails. The growing burden of OA of the knee in the aging Ontario population combined with recent safety concerns about COX-2 inhibitors and long wait times for total joint replacement is placing pressure on the demand for new, effective technologies to manage the pain of OA. Hylan G-F 20 is derived from rooster comb hyaluronan (HA). At the time of writing, eight viscosupplement hyaluronic products are licensed in Canada. Hylan G-F 20 is distinguished from the other products by its chemical structure (i.e., cross-linked hyaluronan, hence hylan) and relatively higher molecular weight, which may bestow greater therapeutic viscoelastic properties. A complete treatment cycle of hylan G-F 20 involves an intra-articular injection of 2 ml of hylan G-F 20 once a week for 3 weeks. It is licensed for use for patients in all stages of joint pathology, but should not be used in infected or severely inflamed joints, in joints with large effusion, in patients that have skin diseases or infections in the area of the injection site, or in patients with venous stasis. It is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivities to avian proteins. The Medical Advisory Secretariat used its standard search protocol to review the literature for evidence on the effectiveness of intra-articular hylan G-F 20 compared with placebo, as a substitute for alternate active treatments, or as an adjunct to conventional care for treatment of the pain of OA of the knee. All English-language journal articles and reviews with clearly described designs and methods (i.e., those sufficient to assign a Jadad score to) published or released between 1966 and February 2005 were included. Two more recently published meta-analyses were also included. The databases searched were Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane database and leading international organizations for health technology assessments, including the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessments. The search terms were as follows: hyaluronan, hyaluronate adj sodium, hylan, hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc), Synvisc, Hyalgan, Orthovisc, Supartz, Artz, Artzal, BioHY, NASHA, NRD101, viscosupplementation, osteoarthritis, knee, knee joint. The primary outcome of interest was a clinically significant difference, defined as greater than 10 mm on 100 mm visual analogue scale, or a change from baseline of more than 20% in the mean magnitude of pain relief experienced among patients treated with hylan G-F 20 compared with those treated with the control intervention. One clinical epidemiologist reviewed the full-text reports and extracted data using an extraction form. Key variables included, but were not limited to, the characteristics of the patients, method of randomization, type of control intervention, outcome measures for effectiveness and safety, and length of follow-up. The quality of the studies and level of the evidence was initially scored by one clinical epidemiologist using the Jadad scale and GRADE approach. Level of quality depends on the amount of certainty about the magnitude of effect and is based on study designs, extent of methodological limitations, consistency of results and applicability (i.e. directness) to the Ontario clinical context. The GRADE approach also permits comment on the strength of recommendations resulting from the evidence, based on estimates of the magnitude of effect relative to the magnitude of risk and burden and the level of certainty around these estimates. The quality assessments were subsequently peer-reviewed. The literature search revealed 2 previous health technology assessments, 3 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials, 1 Cochrane review and meta-analysis encompassing 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared hylan G-F 20 to either placebo or active treatments, 11 RCTs of hylan G-F 20 (all included in the Cochrane review), and 10 observational studies. Given the preponderance of evidence, the Medical Advisory Secretariat's analysis focused on studies with Level 1 evidence of effectiveness (i.e., the meta-analyses of RCTs and the RCTs). Only safety data from the observational studies were included. The authors of the 2 health technology assessments concluded that the data were sparse and poor quality. There was some evidence that hylan G-F 20 delivered a small, clinical benefit at 3 to 6 months after treatment on a magnitude comparable to NSAIDs and intra-articular steroids. Hylan G-F 20 appeared to carry a risk of a local adverse reaction of in the range of 3% to 18% per 100 injections, but there was no apparent risk of a severe adverse event, although the data were limited. Each of the 3 meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of intra-articular hyaluronans had only 3 trials involving hylan G-F 20. There results were inconsistent, with one study concluding that intra-articular hyaluronans were efficacious, whereas the 2 other analyses concluded the effect size was small (0.32) and probably not clinically significant. The risk of a minor adverse event ranged from 8% to 19% per 100 injections. Major adverse events were rare. The authors of the Cochrane review concluded that a pooled analysis supported the efficacy of hyaluronans, including hylan G-F 20. The 5- to 13-week post-injection period showed an improvement from baseline of 11% to 54% for pain and 9% to 15% for function. Comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs, and longer-term benefits were noted in against steroids. Few adverse events were noted. When the Medical Advisory Secretariat applied the criterion of clinical significance to the magnitude of pain relief reported in the RCTs on hylan G-F 20, the following was noted:There was inconsistent evidence that hylan G-F 20 was clinically superior to placebo at 5 to 26 weeks after treatment.There was consistent evidence that, in terms of delivering pain relief, hylan G-F 20 was no better or worse than NSAIDs or intra-articular steroids at 5 to 26 weeks after treatment.There was consistent evidence that hylan G-F 20 was not clinically superior to other hyaluronic products.There was consistent evidence that hylan G-F 20 delivered a small magnitude of clinical benefit at 12 to 52 weeks post-injection when administered as an adjunct to conventional care.There were limitations to the methods in many of the RCTs involving hylan G-F 20. When only the results from the higher-quality studies were considered, there was level 2 evidence that hylan G-F 20 was not clinically superior to placebo (or another hyaluronan) at 1 to 26 weeks after treatment in older patients with advanced disease for whom total knee replacement was indicated. There was level 2 evidence that hylan G-F 2- was comparable to NSAIDs at 4 to 13 weeks after treatment, and level 2 evidence that hylan G-F 20 was superior to placebo as an adjunct to conventional care 4 to 26 weeks after treatment. With respect to safety, overall, hylan G-F 20 carries a risk of a minor, local adverse event rate of about 8% to 19% per 100 injections. Incidents of moderate-severe post-injection inflammatory joint reactions have been reported, but the likelihood appears to be low (0.15% of patients). Case-costing estimates suggest that the annual cost of 2 treatment cycles of hylan G-F 20 (plus analgesics for breakthrough pain) is almost equivalent to the annual cost of taking a NSAID (with a gastroprotective agent) and is more expensive that taking intra-articular corticosteroids (plus analgesics for breakthrough pain). The estimated cost of funding hylan G-F 20 as an adjunct to conventional therapy (i.e., any of analgesics, NSAIDs, intra-articular steroids, physiotherapy, and surgery) is $700 per patient per year. Given the huge burden of mild to moderate OA among adults who seek medical care for it in Ontario (about 300,000), funding hylan G-F 20 as an adjunct to existing treatment could be expensive, depending on its diffusion and uptake. If only 10% to 30% of patients choose this option, then the estimated budget impact would be $21 million to $63 million (Cdn) per year. When the benefits relative to the risks and costs are considered, NSAIDs and hylan G-F 20 appear comparable, as the table shows. Consequently, there's little evidence on which to recommend hylan G-F 20 over NSAIDs, except perhaps for patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs, although this evidence is indirect, since no studies looked specifically at this population.

{"text": "The glucuronidation of 17beta-estradiol (beta-estradiol) and 17alpha-estradiol (epiestradiol) was studied to elucidate how the orientation of the 17-OH group affects conjugation at the 3-OH or the 17-OH of either diastereomer. Recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10 conjugated one or both diastereomers, mainly at the 3-OH. The activity of UGT1A4 was low and unique because it was directed merely toward the 17-OH of both aglycones. UGT1A10 exhibited particularly high estradiol glucuronidation activity, the rate and affinity of which were significantly higher in the case of beta-estradiol than with epiestradiol. UGT1A9 did not catalyze estradiol glucuronidation, but UGT1A9-catalyzed scopoletin glucuronidation was competitively inhibited by beta-estradiol. UGT2B4, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17 exclusively conjugated the estradiols at the 17-OH position in a highly stereoselective fashion. UGT2B4 was specific for epiestradiol; UGT2B7 glucuronidated both diastereomers, with high affinity for epiestradiol, whereas UGT2B17 only glucuronidated beta-estradiol. UGT2B15 glucuronidated both estradiols at the 3-OH, with a strong preference for epiestradiol. Human UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 glucuronidated both diastereoisomers at both hydroxyl groups. Microsomal studies revealed that human liver mainly yielded epiestradiol 17-O-glucuronide, and human intestine primarily yielded beta-estradiol 3-O-glucuronide, whereas rat liver preferentially formed beta-estradiol 17-O-glucuronide. Of the three recombinant rat UGTs that were examined in this study, rUGT2B1 was specific for the 17-OH of beta-estradiol, rUGT2B2 did not catalyze estradiol glucuronidation, whereas rUGT2B3 exhibited high activity toward the 17-OH in both diastereoisomers. The results show that although many UGTs can catalyze estradiol glucuronidation, there are marked differences in their kinetics, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity.", "meta": {"pmid": 18719240}}

We analyzed the expression of 11 CT antigens in bone marrow samples from patients with MM (n=55) and healthy donors (n=32) using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CT antigens were frequently expressed in MM with 56% (MAGEC2), 55% (MAGEA3), 35% (SSX1), 20% (SSX4, SSX5), 16% (SSX2), 15% (BAGE), 7% (NY-ESO-1), and 6% (ADAM2, LIPI) expressing the given antigen. Importantly, CT antigens were not expressed in healthy bone marrow. Analyzing patients with MM (n=66) for antibody responses against MAGEA3, SSX2, and NY-ESO-1, we found strong antibody responses against CT antigens preferentially in patients who had received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Antibody responses against NY-ESO-1 correlated with NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against peptide NY-ESO-1(51-62) and CD4+ responses against NY-ESO-1(121-140) in 1 of these patients. These allogeneic immune responses were not detectable in pretransplantation samples and in the patients' stem cell donors, indicating that CT antigens might indeed represent natural targets for graft-versus-myeloma effects. Immune responses induced by alloSCT could be boosted by active CT antigen-specific immunotherapy, which might help to achieve long-lasting remissions in patients with MM.", "meta": {"pmid": 17023585}}

Branched chain 4-alkylphenols have been shown to retard testicular growth and stimulate vitellogenin synthesis in freshwater fish. We conducted in vivo studies in order to determine the fate and persistence of radiolabeled 4-tert-octylphenol (tOP) in the cyprinid fish, rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus). Sexually mature rudd were exposed to a concentration of 4.7 microg/L of [14C] tOP in a flow through system for 10 days. Radioactive residues were extracted from soft tissues and analyzed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. tOP accumulated as the major residue in muscle, ovary, and testis with bioconcentration factors of 24, 85, and 169, respectively. tOP residues in blood, gill, kidney, liver, and bile were extensively metabolized. Analysis of tOP residues in bile revealed 10 major metabolites, which were identified by GC-MS as products of aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, glucuronidation, and glucosidation. Depuration studies with exposed fish placed in clean water for up to 10 days resulted in a rapid loss of soluble residues from the tissues with half-lives of between 0.7 and 1.0 days (muscle, testis, ovary, gill, blood, kidney), 1.7 days (liver), and 5.9 days (bile). A further portion of radioactive residues was extracted from blood, gill, kidney, and liver after alkaline digestion, suggesting the formation of covalently bound protein adducts in these tissues. This study suggests that although para-alkyphenolic xenoestrogens can accumulate in muscle and the gonads of adult fish, residues are rapidly depurated from these tissues. Furthermore, analysis of the parent alkylphenol in bile, after hydrolysis of the conjugates, is likely to significantly underestimate the total concentration of alkylphenol residues and may not serve as an appropriate biomarker for quantifying the exposure of wild fish to alkylphenols.", "meta": {"pmid": 12188353}}
{"text": "Screening, management, and follow-up of Grade 3 and 4 blunt carotid artery injuries (BCAIs) remain controversial. These high-grade BCAIs were analyzed to define their natural history and establish a rational management plan based on lesion progression and cerebral infarction. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all blunt traumatic carotid and vertebral artery injuries from August 2003 to April 2013 was performed, and Grade 3 and 4 BCAIs were identified. The authors define Grade 3 injuries as stenosis of the vessel greater than 50%, or the development of a pseudoaneurysm, and Grade 4 injuries as complete vessel occlusion. Demographic information, imaging findings, number of images obtained per individual, length of radiographic follow-up examination, radiographic outcome at end of follow-up period, treatment(s), and documentation of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were recorded. Fifty-three Grade 3 BCAIs in 44 patients and 5 Grade 4 BCAIs in 5 patients were identified and had available follow-up information. The mean follow-up duration for Grade 3 BCAIs was 113 days, and the mean follow-up for Grade 4 BCAIs was 78 days. Final imaging of Grade 3 BCAIs showed that 53% of cases were radiographically stable, 11% had resolved, and 11% were improved, whereas 25% had radiographically worsened. In terms of treatment, 75% of patients received aspirin (ASA) alone, 5% received various medications, and 2% received no treatment. Eighteen percent of the patients in the Grade 3 BCAI group underwent endovascular intervention, and in all of these cases, treatment with ASA was continued after the procedure. Final imaging of the Grade 4 BCAIs showed that 60% remained stable (with persistent occlusion), whereas the remaining arteries improved (with recanalization of the vessel). All patients in the Grade 4 BCAI follow-up group were treated with ASA, although in 1 patient treatment was transitioned to Coumadin. There were 3 cases of cerebral infarction that appeared to be related to Grade 3 BCAIs (7% of 44 patients in the Grade 3 group), and 1 case of stroke that appeared to be related to a Grade 4 BCAI. All identified cases of stroke developed soon after hospital admission. Although the posttraumatic cerebral infarction rate may be overestimated, the results of this study suggest that the Grade 3 and 4 BCAIs carry the highest stroke risk of the blunt cerebrovascular injuries, and those infarctions were identified on or shortly after hospital admission. Despite a 40% recanalization rate in the Grade 4 BCAI group and an 89% rate of persistent pseudoaneurysm in the Grade 3 BCAI group, follow-up imaging showed progressive worsening without radiographic improvement in only a small number of patients, and these findings alone did not correlate with adverse clinical outcome. Follow-up protocols may require amending; however, further prospective studies are needed to make conclusive changes as they relate to management.", "meta": {"pmid": 25526279}}

We herein examined 612 index patients with either a Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, hereditary sensory neuropathy, familial amyloid neuropathy, or small fiber neuropathy using a customized multigene panel based on the next generation sequencing technique. In 121 cases (19.8%), we identified at least one putative pathogenic mutation. Of these, 54.4% showed an autosomal dominant, 33.9% an autosomal recessive, and 11.6% an X-linked inheritance. The most frequently affected genes were PMP22 (16.4%), GJB1 (10.7%), MPZ, and SH3TC2 (both 9.9%), and MFN2 (8.3%). We further detected likely or known pathogenic variants in HINT1, HSPB1, NEFL, PRX, IGHMBP2, NDRG1, TTR, EGR2, FIG4, GDAP1, LMNA, LRSAM1, POLG, TRPV4, AARS, BIC2, DHTKD1, FGD4, HK1, INF2, KIF5A, PDK3, REEP1, SBF1, SBF2, SCN9A, and SPTLC2 with a declining frequency. Thirty-four novel variants were considered likely pathogenic not having previously been described in association with any disorder in the literature. In one patient, two homozygous mutations in HK1 were detected in the multigene panel, but not by whole exome sequencing. A novel missense mutation in KIF5A was considered pathogenic because of the highly compatible phenotype. In one patient, the plasma sphingolipid profile could functionally prove the pathogenicity of a mutation in SPTLC2. One pathogenic mutation in MPZ was identified after being previously missed by Sanger sequencing. We conclude that panel based next generation sequencing is a useful, time- and cost-effective approach to assist clinicians in identifying the correct diagnosis and enable causative treatment considerations.", "meta": {"pmid": 28902413}}
{"text": "Archival tissues from laboratory studies represent a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between genomic changes and agent-induced disease. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of qPCR for detecting genomic changes in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues by determining if a subset of 14 genes from a 90-gene signature derived from microarray data and associated with eventual tumor development could be detected in archival liver, kidney, and lung of rats exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) for 90 days in feed at 1 ppm. These tissues originated from the same rats used in the microarray study. The 14 genes evaluated were Adam8, Cdh13, Ddit4l, Mybl2, Akr7a3, Akr7a2, Fhit, Wwox, Abcb1b, Abcc3, Cxcl1, Gsta5, Grin2c, and the C8orf46 homologue. The qPCR FFPE liver results were compared to the original liver microarray data and to qPCR results using RNA from fresh frozen liver. Archival liver paraffin blocks yielded 30 to 50 \u03bcg of degraded RNA that ranged in size from 0.1 to 4 kB. qPCR results from FFPE and fresh frozen liver samples were positively correlated (p \u2264 0.05) by regression analysis and showed good agreement in direction and proportion of change with microarray data for 11 of 14 genes. All 14 transcripts could be amplified from FFPE kidney RNA except the glutamate receptor gene Grin2c; however, only Abcb1b was significantly upregulated from control. Abundant constitutive transcripts, S18 and \u03b2-actin, could be amplified from lung FFPE samples, but the narrow RNA size range (25-500 bp length) prevented consistent detection of target transcripts. Overall, a discrete gene signature derived from prior transcript profiling and representing cell cycle progression, DNA damage response, and xenosensor and detoxication pathways was successfully applied to archival liver and kidney by qPCR and indicated that gene expression changes in response to subchronic AFB1 exposure occurred predominantly in the liver, the primary target for AFB1-induced tumors. We conclude that an evaluation of gene signatures in archival tissues can be an important toxicological tool for evaluating critical molecular events associated with chemical exposures.", "meta": {"pmid": 22545673}}

The gene is located on human chromosome 20q13, and several rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with insulin resistance and diabetes in different populations. As part of our ongoing investigations into the genetic basis of hypertension, we examined common sequence variants in the gene for association with hypertension, obesity and altered lipid profile in two populations of Japanese and Chinese descent. We re-sequenced all exons, selected intronic sequences and the promoter region in 24 individuals from our cohort. Fourteen SNPs were discovered, and six of these spanning 78 kb were genotyped in 1553 individuals from 672 families. All six SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium, and we found strong association of common risk haplotypes with hypertension in Chinese and Japanese (P<0.0001). In addition, individual SNPs showed association to total plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol levels, as well as obesity measures (body mass index). This analysis supports that PTP-1beta affects plasma lipid levels, and may lead to obesity and hypertension in Japanese and Chinese. Given similar associations found in other populations to insulin resistance and diabetes, this gene may play a crucial role in the development of the characteristic metabolic changes seen in patients with the metabolic syndrome.", "meta": {"pmid": 15229188}}

In addition to these 2 types of contrasting neoplasms, several other subtypes can be distinguished, each characterized by specific phenotypic, as well as genotypic features. Recently, the epigenotype, as evident from differentially methylated DNA loci, has been proposed to be useful as a further criterion to distinguish between tumor types. In our study, we screened 139 tissue samples, including 33 pilocytic astrocytomas, 46 astrocytomas of different grades, 7 oligoastrocytomas, 10 oligodendrogliomas, 10 glioblastoma multiforme samples and 33 control tissues, for methylation at CpG islands of 15 different gene loci.

Seven of these loci showed tumor specific methylation changes. We found tissue as well as grade specific methylation profiles. Interestingly, pilocytic astrocytomas showed no evidence of CpG island hypermethylation, but were significantly hypomethylated, relative to control tissues, at MYOD1.

The tapeworm medication, niclosamide is being assessed for repurposing to treat numerous diseases, including end-stage cancer metastasis and hepatic steatosis. In this study, we investigated the potential of niclosamide as a repurposing drug for muscle atrophy. In a myotube atrophy model using the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, niclosamide did not prevent the reduction in myotube diameter or the decreased expression of phosphorylated FOXO3a, which upregulates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of muscle catabolism. Treatment of normal myotubes with niclosamide did not activate mTOR, a major regulator of muscle protein synthesis, and increased the expression of atrogin-1, which is induced in catabolic states. Niclosamide treatment also inhibited myogenesis in muscle precursor cells, enhanced the expression of myoblast markers Pax7 and Myf5, and downregulated the expression of differentiation markers MyoD, MyoG and Myh2. In an animal model of muscle atrophy, niclosamide did not improve muscle mass, grip strength or muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Muscle atrophy is also feature of cancer cachexia. IC50 analyses indicated that niclosamide was more cytotoxic for myoblasts than cancer cells. In addition, niclosamide did not suppress the induction of iNOS, a key mediator of atrophy, in an in vitro model of cancer cachexia and did not rescue myotube diameter.

{"text": "Myelination of axons facilitates rapid impulse propagation in the nervous system. The axon/myelin-unit becomes impaired in myelin-related disorders and upon normal aging. However, the molecular cause of many pathological features, including the frequently observed myelin outfoldings, remained unknown. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we find that the presence of myelin outfoldings correlates with a loss of cytoskeletal septins in myelin. Regulated by phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-levels, myelin septins (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and the PI(4,5)P2-adaptor anillin form previously unrecognized filaments that extend longitudinally along myelinated axons. By confocal microscopy and immunogold-electron microscopy, these filaments are localized to the non-compacted adaxonal myelin compartment. Genetic disruption of these filaments in Sept8-mutant mice causes myelin outfoldings as a very specific neuropathology. Septin filaments thus serve an important function in scaffolding the axon/myelin-unit, evidently a late stage of myelin maturation. We propose that pathological or aging-associated diminishment of the septin/anillin-scaffold causes myelin outfoldings that impair the normal nerve conduction velocity.", "meta": {"pmid": 27504968}}

Methylation of at least one of the group of genes involved in DNA repair/drug detoxification (BRCA1, GSTP1, and MGMT) was associated with improved response to chemotherapy (P = 0.013). We have examined the frequency of a polymorphism in the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3b6, which has been previously reported to affect gene transcription and cancer risk. The genetic polymorphism in the DNMT3b6 gene promoter (at position -149) is not significantly associated with the concordant methylation observed, but is weakly associated with the overall frequency of methylation at the genes examined (P = 0.04, n = 56).

The optomotor response (OMR) was examined using a homemade optomotor system equipped with light-emitting diodes as light stimulation. A robust OMR was restored in the ChR2-mutant-expressing TKO mice; however, significant pupillary constriction was observed only for the ChR2-L132C/T159S mutant. The ability to evoke an OMR was dependent on both the light intensity and grating frequency. The most light-sensitive frequency for the three ChR2 mutants was approximately 0.042 cycles per degree. Among the three ChR2 mutants, ChR2-L132C/T159S was the most light sensitive, followed by ChR2-L132C/T159C and ChR2-L132C.

The effects of structural modification on the inhibitory activity were examined. Except at the 2-position on the imidazole, alkyl substitution increased the inhibitory potency, probably because of increased lipophilicity. Substitution at the 2-position caused marked diminution in inhibitory activity, possibly due to steric hindrance.

Moreover, I discuss recent studies describing significant variations in the structure and regulation of PAF-AH from diverse species, which is likely to have important implications for the function of this enzyme in vivo.

{"text": "Myopalladin (MYPN) is a striated muscle-specific immunoglobulin domain-containing protein located in the sarcomeric Z-line and I-band. MYPN gene mutations are causative for dilated (DCM), hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. In a yeast two-hybrid screening, MYPN was found to bind to titin in the Z-line, which was confirmed by microscale thermophoresis. Cardiac analyses of MYPN knockout (MKO) mice showed the development of mild cardiac dilation and systolic dysfunction, associated with decreased myofibrillar isometric tension generation and increased resting tension at longer sarcomere lengths. MKO mice exhibited a normal hypertrophic response to transaortic constriction (TAC), but rapidly developed severe cardiac dilation and systolic dysfunction, associated with fibrosis, increased fetal gene expression, higher intercalated disc fold amplitude, decreased calsequestrin-2 protein levels, and increased desmoplakin and SORBS2 protein levels. Cardiomyocyte analyses showed delayed Ca2+ release and reuptake in unstressed MKO mice as well as reduced Ca2+ spark amplitude post-TAC, suggesting that altered Ca2+ handling may contribute to the development of DCM in MKO mice.", "meta": {"pmid": 34558411}}
{"text": "Non-degradative ubiquitin chains and phosphorylation events govern signaling responses by innate immune receptors. The deubiquitinase CYLD in complex with SPATA2 is recruited to receptor signaling complexes by the ubiquitin ligase LUBAC and regulates Met1- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin and receptor signaling outcomes. Here, we investigate the molecular determinants of CYLD activity. We reveal that two CAP-Gly domains in CYLD are ubiquitin-binding domains and demonstrate a requirement of CAP-Gly3 for CYLD activity and regulation of immune receptor signaling. Moreover, we identify a phosphorylation switch outside of the catalytic USP domain, which activates CYLD toward Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. The phosphorylated residue Ser568 is a novel tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-regulated phosphorylation site in CYLD and works in concert with Ser418 to enable CYLD-mediated deubiquitination and immune receptor signaling. We propose that phosphorylated CYLD, together with SPATA2 and LUBAC, functions as a ubiquitin-editing complex that balances Lys63- and Met1-linked polyubiquitin at receptor signaling complexes to promote LUBAC signaling.", "meta": {"pmid": 34610306}}
{"text": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is the principal constituent of baby bottles, reusable water bottles, metal cans, and plastic food containers. BPA exerts estrogen-like activity by interacting with the classical estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) and through the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR30/GPER). In this regard, recent studies have shown that GPER was involved in the proliferative effects induced by BPA in both normal and tumor cells. We studied the transduction signaling pathways through which BPA influences cell proliferation and migration in human breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We used as a model system SKBR3 breast cancer cells and CAFs that lack the classical ERs. Specific pharmacological inhibitors and gene-silencing procedures were used to show that BPA induces the expression of the GPER target genes c-FOS, EGR-1, and CTGF through the GPER/EGFR/ERK transduction pathway in SKBR3 breast cancer cells and CAFs. Moreover, we observed that GPER is required for growth effects and migration stimulated by BPA in both cell types. Results indicate that GPER is involved in the biological action elicited by BPA in breast cancer cells and CAFs. Hence, GPER-mediated signaling should be included among the transduction mechanisms through which BPA may stimulate cancer progression.", "meta": {"pmid": 22552965}}
{"text": "The impact of formulary management strategies on utilization and expenditures in overactive bladder (OAB) treatment has not been extensively investigated. In 2013, step therapy (ST) policies for 2 branded OAB treatments, mirabegron and fesoterodine, were removed from Humana Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans and Medicare prescription drug plans (PDP), allowing for an examination of the effect of ST policies on OAB medication use patterns and costs. To assess the impact of removal of formulary restriction policies for mirabegron and fesoterodine on medication utilization patterns and costs associated with OAB treatment in Medicare patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study design was utilized. Subjects included individuals enrolled in Humana MAPD plans or PDPs, aged \u2265 65 years, with \u2265 1 prescription for an OAB medication in 2013. Patient demographic characteristics, OAB medication utilization, and pharmacy cost trends in 2013 were described. OAB medication use was calculated as the number of 30-day-supply equivalent medication claims and reported as a percentage of the total number of 30-day-supply equivalent claims across all OAB products. OAB medication expenditures were calculated as a percentage of the sum of pharmacy costs for OAB medications and reported separately for each month and drug during 2013. Temporal trends of OAB medication utilization and expenditures in 2013 were calculated using ordinary least squares regression. Of 194,511 patients, trends in utilization of OAB medications indicated that on average, there was a statistically significant monthly increase in utilization of mirabegron (regression coefficient [B] = 274; P < 0.001; 95% CI: 218, 330), fesoterodine (B = 167; P < 0.001; 95% CI = 129, 205), oxybutynin extended release (ER; B = 357; P = 0.011; 95% CI = 99, 614), and trospium ER (B = 33; P = 0.001; 95% CI = 17, 50) and statistically significant decreases in utilization of solifenacin (B = -202; P = 0.048; 95% CI = -402, -2), tolterodine ER (B = -287; P = 0.002; 95% CI = -437, -137), darifenacin (B = -94; P < 0.001; 95% CI = -128, -61), and trospium immediate release (IR; B = -22; P = 0.001; 95% CI = -32, -12). Total OAB medication expenditures significantly increased an average of 0.12% for each month during the course of 2013 (B = 0.12; P = 0.026; 95% CI = 0.017, -0.223). While monthly oxybutynin IR utilization did not change significantly throughout 2013 (B = 228; P = 0.169; 95% CI = -114, -570), it demonstrated the largest average monthly expenditure increase (B = 0.082; P < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.056, 0.108). When removing oxybutynin IR costs from the total OAB medication costs, the trend in total OAB medication average monthly expenditures was not significant (B = 0.038; P = 0.365; 95% CI = -0.051, -0.126). An over 4-fold per-unit-cost increase for oxybutynin IR was noted. Utilization of 2 branded OAB products increased in the months after ST removal with minimal cost impact. One of the possible reasons total OAB expenditures increased may have been due to the increased cost of the largest-volume generic product, oxybutynin IR.

Chromosome aberrations in MM are complex and represent a hallmark of the disease, involving many chromosomes that are altered both numerically and structurally. Nearly half of the cases are nonhyperdiploid and show IGH translocations with the following partner genes: CCND1, FGFR3 and MMSET, MAF, MAFB, and CCND3. The remaining 50% are grouped into a hyperdiploid group that is characterized by multiple trisomies involving chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21. In this study, we analyzed the immunoglobulin light chain kappa (IGK, 2p12) and lambda (IGL, 22q11) loci in 150 cases, mostly with MM but in a few cases monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), without IGH translocations. We identified aberrations in 27% (= 40 patients) including rearrangements (12%), gains (12%), and deletions (4.6%).

{"text": "Mutations in the Integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2b/BRI2) gene, which codes for a protein called BRI2, cause familial British and Danish dementia (FBD and FDD). Loss of BRI2 function and/or accumulation of amyloidogenic mutant BRI2-derived peptides have been proposed to mediate FDD and FBD pathogenesis by impairing synaptic Long-term potentiation (LTP). However, the precise site and nature of the synaptic dysfunction remain unknown. Here we use a genetic approach to inactivate Itm2b in either presynaptic (CA3), postsynaptic (CA1) or both (CA3\u2009+\u2009CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway in both female and male mice. We show that after CA3\u2009+\u2009CA1 Itm2b inactivation, spontaneous glutamate release and AMPAR-mediated responses are decreased, while short-term synaptic facilitation is increased. Moreover, AMPAR-mediated responses are decreased after postsynaptic but not presynaptic deletion of Itm2b. In contrast, the probability of spontaneous glutamate release is decreased, while short-term synaptic facilitation is increased, primarily after presynaptic deletion of Itm2b. Collectively, these results indicate a dual physiological role of Itm2b in the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission at both presynaptic termini and postsynaptic termini and suggest that presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunctions may be a pathogenic event leading to dementia and neurodegeneration in FDD and FBD.", "meta": {"pmid": 30890756}}

{"text": "The objective of this study was to consider endocannabinoid system as inflammatory markers in bovine endometrium to better understand the role of this system in regulating many of the functions that are related to inflammatory condition. At day 26 post-partum, fourteen cows were divided into two groups depending on the inflammatory condition: 1- subclinical endometritis (n\u00a0=\u00a07, with purulent or mucopurulent uterine discharge detectable in the vagina) and 2- healthy (n\u00a0=\u00a07, No (muco)) purulent discharge. Blood samples were collected at 26 and 30\u00a0days relative to calving to determine plasma tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) concentrations; moreover, uterine biopsy was carried out on day 26 post-partum to measure mRNA abundance of TNF, interleukin-1B (IL1B), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), endocannabinoid receptor (CNR2), N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPEPLD), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) and monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) by real-time PCR. Results showed mean plasma concentrations of TNF and LBP were lower in healthy cows compared to subclinical endometritis cows (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Relative mRNA expression for NAAA and FAAH was decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and relative mRNA expression for CNR2 and NAPEPLD increased in cows with subclinical endometritis compared to healthy cows. In conclusion, relative mRNA expression of TNF, IL1B and CXCL8 and plasma concentration of LBP increased during inflammatory condition along with decreased endocannabinoids hydrolyzing enzyme (NAAA and FAAH), increased enzymes that synthesize endocannabinoids (NAPEPLD) and relative gene expression of the endocannabinoid receptor; together, these contribute to increased endocannabinoids levels during inflammation. Overall, we provide evidence that endocannabinoid system is altered in endometrium tissue during inflammation through increased mRNA expression of CNR2 and synthesis enzyme and decreased mRNA expression of hydrolyzing enzymes interfere with pro-cytokine production and signalling, which may interfere with the onset and progression of inflammation.", "meta": {"pmid": 29542183}}
{"text": "Sodium-coupled SLC12 cation chloride cotransporters play important roles in cell volume and chloride homeostasis, epithelial fluid secretion, and renal tubular salt reabsorption. These cotransporters are phosphorylated and activated indirectly by With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases through their downstream effector kinases, Ste20- and SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1). Multiple WNK kinases can coexist within a single cell type, although their relative contributions to SPAK/OSR1 activation and salt transport remain incompletely understood. Deletion of specific WNKs from cells that natively express a functional WNK-SPAK/OSR1 network will help resolve these knowledge gaps. Here, we outline a simple method to selectively knock out full-length WNK1 expression from mammalian cells using RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 endonucleases. Two clonal cell lines were generated by using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the WNK1 gene, which produced indels that abolished WNK1 protein expression. Both cell lines exhibited reduced endogenous WNK4 protein abundance, indicating that WNK1 is required for WNK4 stability. Consistent with an on-target effect, the reduced WNK4 abundance was associated with increased expression of the KLHL3/cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and was rescued by exogenous WNK1 overexpression. Although the morphology of the knockout cells was indistinguishable from control, they exhibited low baseline SPAK/OSR1 activity and failed to trigger regulatory volume increase after hypertonic stress, confirming an essential role for WNK1 in cell volume regulation. Collectively, our data show how this new, powerful, and accessible gene-editing technology can be used to dissect and analyze WNK signaling networks. ", "meta": {"pmid": 25477473}}

{"text": "Background: Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare genetic disease caused by Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) deficiency. So far a limited number of variants in several genes have been associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. In this original research and review manuscript the retrospective analysis of known variants in ANOS1 (KAL1), RNF216, WDR11, FGFR1, CHD7, and POLR3A genes is described, along with novel variants identified in patients with CHH by the present study. Methods: Seven GnRH deficient unrelated Cypriot patients underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The identified novel variants were initially examined by in silico computational algorithms and structural analysis of their predicted pathogenicity at the protein level was confirmed. Results: In four non-related GnRH males, a novel X-linked pathogenic variant in ANOS1 gene, two novel autosomal dominant (AD) probably pathogenic variants in WDR11 and FGFR1 genes and one rare AD probably pathogenic variant in CHD7 gene were identified. A rare autosomal recessive (AR) variant in the SRA1 gene was identified in homozygosity in a female patient, whilst two other male patients were also, respectively, found to carry novel or previously reported rare pathogenic variants in more than one genes; FGFR1/POLR3A and SRA1/RNF216. Conclusion: This report embraces the description of novel and previously reported rare pathogenic variants in a series of genes known to be implicated in the biological development of CHH. Notably, patients with CHH can harbor pathogenic rare variants in more than one gene which raises the hypothesis of locus-locus interactions providing evidence for digenic inheritance. The identification of such aberrations by NGS can be very informative for the management and future planning of these patients.", "meta": {"pmid": 32982993}}
{"text": "Voltage-gated potassium channels of the KCNQ (Kv7) subfamily are essential for control of cellular excitability and repolarization in a wide range of cell types. Recently, we and others found that some KCNQ channels functionally and physically interact with sodium-dependent solute transporters, including myo-inositol transporters SMIT1 and SMIT2, potentially facilitating various modes of channel-transporter signal integration. In contrast to indirect effects such as channel regulation by SMIT-transported, myo-inositol-derived phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the mechanisms and functional consequences of the physical interaction of channels with transporters have been little studied. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation with different channel domains, we found that SMIT1 binds to the KCNQ2 pore module. We next tested the effects of SMIT1 co-expression, in the absence of extracellular myo-inositol or other SMIT1 substrates, on fundamental functional attributes of KCNQ2, KCNQ2/3, KCNQ1, and KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels. Without exception, SMIT1 altered KCNQ ion selectivity, sensitivity to extracellular K+, and pharmacology, consistent with an impact on conformation of the KCNQ pore. SMIT1 also altered the gating kinetics and/or voltage dependence of KCNQ2, KCNQ2/3, and KCNQ1-KCNE1. In contrast, SMIT1 had no effect on Kv1.1 (KCNA1) gating, ion selectivity, or pharmacology. We conclude that, independent of its transport activity and indirect regulatory mechanisms involving inositol-derived increases in PIP2, SMIT1, and likely other related sodium-dependent solute transporters, regulates KCNQ channel ion selectivity, gating, and pharmacology by direct physical interaction with the pore module.", "meta": {"pmid": 28793216}}

This is mainly related to the poor quality of life experienced by these patients. Although topical and systemic steroids represent the most common treatment, the variability in success rates and side effects often lead to treatment discontinuation. Recent off-label clinical studies using oral Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g., ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, baraticinib) have shown promising results. However, frequent side effects, such as infections and blood clots have been reported. Therefore, the aim of this research was to enhance the intradermal delivery of tofacitinib citrate with MN arrays. Using crosslinked hydrogels containing modifying agents (urea, sorbitol and sodium chloride), hollow MN arrays were fabricated and then loaded with tofacitinib citrate. Their efficiency in intradermal delivery of tofacitinib was compared with dissolving MN arrays and a control (Aqueous cream BP), using neonatal porcine skin. Despite the fact that the hydrogel was only present on the outer surface, hollow MN arrays showed comparable resistance to compression values and insertion capabilities to dissolving MN arrays. Although hollow MN arrays containing NaCl in the formulation led to slightly higher depositions of tofacitinib in epidermis and dermis of neonatal porcine skin when compared to a control cream, dissolving MN arrays showed superiority in terms of tofacitinib deposition in the dermis. Indeed, at 24\u00a0h of the study, control cream and dissolving MN arrays delivered 143.98 ug/cm2 and 835 ug/cm2 of drug in the dermis, respectively, confirming the enhanced intradermal drug delivery capacity of MN arrays and their potential for treatment of autoimmune skin diseases.", "meta": {"pmid": 33301867}}
{"text": "Primary canalicular bile undergoes a process of fluidization and alkalinization along the biliary tract that is influenced by several factors including hormones, innervation/neuropeptides, and biliary constituents. The excretion of bicarbonate at both the canaliculi and the bile ducts is an important contributor to the generation of the so-called bile-salt independent flow. Bicarbonate is secreted from hepatocytes and cholangiocytes through parallel mechanisms which involve chloride efflux through activation of Cl- channels, and further bicarbonate secretion via AE2/SLC4A2-mediated Cl-/HCO3- exchange. Glucagon and secretin are two relevant hormones which seem to act very similarly in their target cells (hepatocytes for the former and cholangiocytes for the latter). These hormones interact with their specific G protein-coupled receptors, causing increases in intracellular levels of cAMP and activation of cAMP-dependent Cl- and HCO3- secretory mechanisms. Both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes appear to have cAMP-responsive intracellular vesicles in which AE2/SLC4A2 colocalizes with cell specific Cl- channels (CFTR in cholangiocytes and not yet determined in hepatocytes) and aquaporins (AQP8 in hepatocytes and AQP1 in cholangiocytes). cAMP-induced coordinated trafficking of these vesicles to either canalicular or cholangiocyte lumenal membranes and further exocytosis results in increased osmotic forces and passive movement of water with net bicarbonate-rich hydrocholeresis.", "meta": {"pmid": 16773707}}

Mice undergoing UUO were treated with vehicle or rhBMP-7 (300\u03bcg/kg i.p.) every other day for eight days and kidneys analysed for markers of fibrosis and SMAD, MAPK, and PI3K signaling. In the kidney, collecting duct and tubular epithelial cells respond to BMP-7 via activation of SMAD1/5/8. Phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 was reduced in UUO kidneys from vehicle-treated animals yet maintained in UUO kidneys from BMP-7-treated animals, confirming renal bioactivity of exogenous rhBMP-7. BMP-7 inhibited Collagen I\u03b11 and Collagen III\u03b11 gene expression and Collagen I protein accumulation, while increasing expression of Collagen IV\u03b11 in UUO kidneys. Activation of SMAD2, SMAD3, ERK, p38 and PI3K/Akt signaling occurred during fibrogenesis and BMP-7 significantly attenuated SMAD3 and Akt signaling in vivo. Analysis of renal collecting duct (mIMCD) and tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells stimulated with TGF\u03b21 or hypoxia (1% oxygen) to activate Akt provided further evidence that BMP-7 specifically inhibited PI3K/Akt signaling. PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K and BMP-7 increased PTEN expression in vivo and in vitro.

Recombinant human AKR7A3 has been shown to reduce the AFB 1-dialdehyde at rates greater than those of the rat AKR7A1. The activity of AKR7A1 or AKR7A3 may detoxify the AFB 1-dialdehyde, which reacts with proteins, and thereby inhibits AFB 1-induced toxicity; however, direct experimental evidence of this hypothesis was lacking. Two human B lymphoblastoid cell lines, designated pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 and pMF6/1A2, were genetically engineered to stably express AKR7A1 and/or cytochrome P4501A2 (1A2). The pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 cells were refractory to the cytotoxic effects of 3 ng/mL AFB 1, in comparison to pM6/1A2 cells, which were more sensitive. Diminished protection occurred at higher concentrations of AFB 1 in pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 cells, suggesting that additional factors were influencing cell survival. COS-7 cells were transfected with either vector control, rat AKR7A1, or human AKR7A3, and the cells were treated with AFB 1-dialdehyde. There was a 6-fold increase in the dialdehyde LC 50, from 66 microM in vector-transfected cells to 400 microM in AKR7A1-transfected cells, and an 8.5-fold increase from 35 microM in vector-transfected cells to 300 microM in AKR7A3-transfected cells. In both cases, this protective effect of the AFAR enzyme was accompanied by a marked decrease in protein adducts. Fractionation of the cellular protein showed that the mitochondria/nuclei and microsomal fractions contained the highest concentration of protein adducts. The levels of human AKR7A3 and AKR7A2 were measured in 12 human liver samples. The expression of AKR7A3 was detectable in all livers and lower than those of AKR7A2 in 11 of the 12 samples.

Azithromycin, spiramycin and rokitamycin, however, do not appear to have any effect on theophylline pharmacokinetics. The other therapeutic agents considered are cyclosporin, the antiepileptics, carbamazepine and phenytoin, terfenadine, warfarin, oral contraceptives, agents used in the management of gastritis and peptic ulcer and zidovudine. With the exception of interaction with antacids, there is no evidence that azithromycin, unlike most other macrolides, interacts with any of these agents to produce clinically significant adverse effects. The explanation for this variation appears to be azithromycin's inability to induce and bind to the cytochrome P450 IIIA enzyme system.", "meta": {"pmid": 8818854}}

Doxorubicine \u00b1 ifosfamide based cytotoxic chemotherapy, explored in few randomized trials, showed a certain degree of activity, playing an established role only in unresectable disease. Since peculiar chemosensitivity towards alternative drugs was described for different metastatic subtypes in second or further lines, the modern concept of 'histology-driven chemotherapy' has been accepted and employed: gemicitabine \u00b1 dacarbazine, trabectedin and taxanes used respectively in patients with leiomyosarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, angiosarcoma. Recent discoveries about molecular pathways involved in STS tumorogenesis led to develop molecular targeted agents such as imatinib used in advanced dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) or metastatic DFSP-related fibrosarcoma, pazopanib, approved as second line regimen in advanced non-adipocitic STS and recently sunitinib in solitary fibrous tumors, alveolar soft part sarcoma and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.", "meta": {"pmid": 24555529}}
{"text": "Oxidation of low density lipoproteins is an initial step of atherogenesis that generates pro-inflammatory phospholipids, including platelet-activating factor (PAF) and its analogs. PAF is degraded by PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), a circulating enzyme having both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. PAF-AH activity has been postulated to be a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD); however, whether PAF-AH has a causal role or is simply a marker of risk is unclear. The aim of this study was to relate the variability of the genes encoding PAF-AH (PLA2G7) and the PAF-receptor (PTAFR) to the risk of CAD and its complications. All polymorphisms located in putatively functional regions were investigated in a prospective cohort of CAD patients (n = 1314) and a group of healthy controls (n = 485). The whole gene variability was investigated in relation to case-control status, prospective cardiovascular outcome and plasma PAF-AH levels by means of haplotype analyses. All analyses indicated an effect of the PLA2G7/A379V polymorphism independent of the other polymorphisms. The V379 allele was less frequent in CAD patients than in controls and was associated with a lower risk of future cardiovascular events, suggesting that this allele might be protective against the development of CAD. The V379 allele was also associated with a weak increase of plasma PAF-AH activity that was unlikely to explain the protective effect of the allele on risk. A more likely interpretation is that the A379V polymorphism might modify the enzyme function towards a more anti-atherogenic form. Polymorphisms of the PTAFR gene were not related to any phenotype.", "meta": {"pmid": 15115767}}

After 3 months, sera were collected to measure vitamin D levels by LC-MS/MS, gastric tissues were collected for immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses and gastric contents were collected to measure acid levels. The VDD group showed a significant decrease in the acid-secreting parietal cell-specific genes Atp4a and Atp4b when compared with the controls. This reduction was associated with an increased expression of an antral gastrin hormone. VDD gastric tissues also showed a high proliferation rate compared with SDL and SDD using an anti-BrdU antibody.

{"text": "The adaptor protein R7 family binding protein (R7BP) modulates G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and desensitization by controlling the function of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. R7BP is expressed throughout the brain and appears to modulate the membrane localization and stability of three proteins that belong to R7 RGS family: RGS6, RGS7, and RGS9-2. RGS9-2 is a potent negative modulator of opiate and psychostimulant addiction and promotes the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine, whereas the role of RGS6 and RGS7 in addiction remains unknown. Recent studies revealed that functional deletion of R7BP reduces R7 protein activity by preventing their anchoring to the cell membrane and enhances GPCR responsiveness in the basal ganglia. Here, we take advantage of R7BP knockout mice in order to examine the way interventions in R7 proteins function throughout the brain affect opiate actions. Our results suggest that R7BP is a negative modulator of the analgesic and locomotor activating actions of morphine. We also report that R7BP contributes to the development of morphine tolerance. Finally, our data suggest that although prevention of R7BP actions enhances the analgesic responses to morphine, it does not affect the severity of somatic withdrawal signs. Our data suggest that interventions in R7BP actions enhance the analgesic effect of morphine and prevent tolerance, without affecting withdrawal, pointing to R7BP complexes as potential new targets for analgesic drugs.", "meta": {"pmid": 22089315}}

Additionally, a large comparative 24-week trial showed that cilostazol 100 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than pentoxifylline 400mg three times daily (pentoxifylline was not significantly different from placebo). Cilostazol was generally well tolerated. Adverse events reported significantly more often with cilostazol than with placebo included headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools, infection, rhinitis and peripheral edema and in comparison with pentoxifylline were headache, diarrhea, abnormal stools and palpitations. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in intensity, transient or resolved after symptomatic treatment and rarely required treatment withdrawal. Significant drug interactions are observed when cilostazol is coadministered with other agents that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (e.g. erythromycin or diltiazem) or CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole). As a result, in Europe cilostazol is contraindicated in patients receiving CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors and in the US it is recommended that dosage reduction for cilostazol be considered during coadministration of cilostazol and CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitors. Conversely, cilostazol itself does not appear to inhibit CYP3A4. Coadministration of cilostazol with aspirin or warfarin did not result in any clinically significant changes to coagulation parameters, bleeding time or platelet aggregation. In six of eight well designed clinical trials, cilostazol was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing walking distances and improving the quality of life of patients with moderate to severe intermittent claudication. In addition, limited comparative data have shown that cilostazol has superior efficacy compared with pentoxifylline. Cilostazol is also generally well tolerated. Additional comparative trials are required to confirm these results, to determine the place of cilostazol in relation to other agents or exercise therapy and risk factor reduction alone, and to establish the effects of long-term treatment with cilostazol in patients with intermittent claudication.

The growth of two non-T,non-B-cell lines (Reh, P30/OHK) and six myeloid cell lines (ML-1, U937, THP-1-0, P31/FUJ, P39/TSU, HEL) was found to be significantly inhibited by a 72 hr treatment with PAC-4D. Although the levels of sensitivity of these cell lines to PAC-4D were different, it was common to all these cell lines that increasing the dose of PAC-4D did not augment the growth-inhibitory action above a certain level. Neither dose-dependent nor time-dependent growth-inhibitory action was observed, namely, exposure to 100 U/ml of PAC-4D for 48 hr was sufficient to exhibit maximum growth-inhibitory action. Furthermore U937 cells were found to become completely resistant to PAC-4D during a continuous 12-day exposure to it. This resistance, however, was lost on culture of the cells with PAC-4D-free growth medium for 15 days.

There is emerging evidence that IL-17A is generated in the cancer microenvironment of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the role of IL-17A in NPC remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the direct influence of IL-17A stimulation on the proliferation of human NPC cells and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, E1A binding protein p300 (p300)-mediated AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt1) acetylation and its role in regulating the proliferation of NPC cells was investigated. The results of the current study demonstrated that IL-17A stimulation in vitro increased the proliferation of human NPC cells. Furthermore, Akt1 acetylation was identified to be enhanced in human NPC cells induced by IL-17A. Additionally, p300 induction was demonstrated to be required for Akt1 acetylation in human NPC cells following exposure to IL-17A. Functionally, p300-mediated Akt1 acetylation contributed to the proliferation of human NPC cells stimulated by IL-17A. In conclusion, the results of the present demonstrate a novel activity of IL-17A that promotes human NPC cell proliferation via p300-mediated Akt1 acetylation.

Although off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries, it tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, in urgent public health crises, it is often the only realistic source of a meaningful potential solution. To be considered for real-world repurposing, drug candidates should ideally have a track record of safety, affordability, and wide accessibility. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, the absence of a central repository of off-label uses presents a barrier to the immediate identification and selection of the safest, potentially useful interventions. Using the current COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse at the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and pleiotropically target the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so dangerous.

We evaluated expression of factors involved in TLR signaling cascades, production of downstream effector immune mediators, and TLR-expression in CD4+ and CD14+ cells. Results were compared with those obtained in healthy controls (HCs). ESN individuals showed: 1) comparable percentages of CD14+/TLR4+ and CD4+/TLR8+ CD14+/TLR8+ cells; 2) higher responsiveness to poly I:C, LPS, imiquimod, and ssRNA40 stimulation, associated with significantly increased production of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CCL3; 3) augmented expression of mRNA specific for other targets (CCL2, CSF3, CSF2, IL-1alpha, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, cyclooxygenase 2) demonstrated by broader TLRs pathway expression analyses; and 4) increased MyD88/MyD88s(short) ratio, mainly following TLR7/8 stimulation. We also compared TLR-agonist-stimulated cytokine/chemokine production in CD14+ PBMCs and observed decreased IFN-beta production in ESN individuals compared with HCs upon TLR7/8-agonist stimulation.

Inulin enriched with oligofructose (1:1, Synergy1) was fermented with human gut flora. SCFA were quantified and a SCFA mixture was prepared accordingly. Colonocytes were incubated (4-12 h) with the Synergy1 fermentation supernatant (SFS), faeces control, a mixture of the three major SCFA (each 0-15 %, v/v) or butyrate (0-50 mM). Metabolic activity was determined to assess trophic effects and cytotoxicity. Expression of ninety-six genes related to biotransformation was studied using cDNA macroarrays. Results on modulated GST were reassessed with real-time PCR and GST activity was measured. Fermentation of inulin resulted in 2-3-fold increases of SCFA. The samples were non-cytotoxic. SFS increased metabolic activity, pointing to trophic effects. The samples modulated gene expression with different response patterns. Key results were that GSTM2 (2.0-fold) and GSTM5 (2.2-fold) were enhanced by SFS, whereas the SCFA mixture reduced expression. The faeces control enhanced GSTA4 (2.0-fold), but reduced GSTM2 (0.2-fold) and GSTM5 (0.2-fold). Realtime qPCR confirmed the induction of GSTM2 and GSTM5 by SFS and of GSTA4 and GSTT2 by butyrate.

Herein, we explore the roles of MSI1 as well as the underlying mechanisms in the regulation of drug resistance and tumorigenesis of GBM cells. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of MSI1 effectively protected GBM cells from drug-induced apoptosis through down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes; whereas inhibition of AKT withdrew the MSI1-induced anti-apoptosis and cell survival. We further showed that MSI1 robustly promoted the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which was governed by AKT activity.

We thus investigated whether and how virus affects migration of human epithelial cells and specifically how the nucleocapsid protein (N) modulates the cellular proteome and interactome using human Caco-2 cells in a wound-healing assay with Hazara virus as a model. Here, Hazara virus blocked cell migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner, disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and specifically reduced the expression of the IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) and water channel aquaporin 6 (AQP6) that regulate cytoskeletal organization, water homeostasis and vesicle communication. Moreover, in the Caco-2 cell proteome, we identified several distinct groups of molecules associating with N upon Hazara virus infection, being involved in the ensemble of important cellular processes, e.g., chaperone activity, metabolism, cellular defense against infections, cell morphology, and migration. These events do not only facilitate the virus life cycle, but they are also crucial for membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics, cellular self-renewal and wound healing, being so essential for body integrity and homeostasis.", "meta": {"pmid": 29209610}}
{"text": "The phenotypic spectrum caused by SCN2A mutations includes benign neonatal/infantile seizures, Ohtahara syndrome, infantile spasms, West syndrome, and other unclassified epileptic phenotypes. Mutations in SCN2A have been implicated in neonatal seizure cases. Here, we described a Chinese family with 2 members having juvenile-onset myoclonus and identified a novel SCN2A point mutation within this family. The 21-year-old male proband suffered from frequent myoclonus at 11 years old with subsequent progressive ataxia. His elder maternal half-sister also experienced myoclonus. Genomic DNA of the patients was extracted from the peripheral blood cells of the proband, elder maternal half-sister, parents, and uncle of the proband. Targeted next-generation sequencing was used to screen gene mutations in the proband. The potential functional effects of mutations within SCN2A were predicted In silico analyses. Genetic testing revealed a novel SCN2A variant, c.T4820C, which contains a highly conserved amino acid substitution within segment S5 (p.V1607A). This mutation was predicted to produce a dysfunctional Nav1.2 protein by Mutation Taster and Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN). Genotype-phenotype correlation showed an incomplete penetrance of p.V1607A. The proband was treated by multiple antiepileptic drugs. These included carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproate, and topiramate. The duration of follow up was 2 years, and the proband developed drug-resistant epilepsy. The case gives us the lesson that SCN2A mutation can contribute to juvenile-onset myoclonus.

{"text": "Fibroblast growth factor receptors (Fgfrs) are expressed in the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme of the developing kidney. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that exogenous fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) increase growth and maturation of the metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud. Deletion of fgf7, fgf10, and fgfr2IIIb (the receptor isoform that binds Fgf7 and Fgf10) in mice lead to smaller kidneys with fewer collecting ducts and nephrons. Overexpression of a dominant negative receptor isoform in transgenic mice has revealed more striking defects including renal aplasia or severe dysplasia. Moreover, deletion of many fgf ligands and receptors in mice results in early embryonic lethality, making it difficult to determine their roles in kidney development. Recently, conditional targeting approaches revealed that deletion of fgf8 from the metanephric mesenchyme interrupts nephron formation. Furthermore, deletion of fgfr2 from the ureteric bud resulted in both ureteric bud branching and stromal mesenchymal patterning defects. Deletion of both fgfr1 and fgfr2 in the metanephric mesenchyme resulted in renal aplasia, characterized by defects in metanephric mesenchyme formation and initial ureteric bud elongation and branching. Thus, Fgfr signaling is critical for growth and patterning of all renal lineages at early and later stages of kidney development.", "meta": {"pmid": 16932896}}

Retrotranspositions have independently generated additional YY family members in multiple species. Although Drosophila YY1 [pleiohomeotic (Pho)] and its homolog [pleiohomeotic-like (Phol)] redundantly control homeotic gene expression, the regulatory contributions of YY1-homologs have not yet been examined in other species. Indeed, targets for the mammalian YY1 homolog YY2 are completely unknown. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we found that lentiviral constructs containing short hairpin loop inhibitory RNAs for human YY1 (shYY1) and its homolog YY2 (shYY2) caused significant changes in both shared and distinguishable gene sets in human cells. Ribosomal protein genes were the most significant gene set upregulated by both shYY1 and shYY2, although combined shYY1/2 knock downs were not additive. In contrast, shYY2 reversed the anti-proliferative effects of shYY1, and shYY2 particularly altered UV damage response, platelet-specific and mitochondrial function genes. We found that decreases in YY1 or YY2 caused inverse changes in UV sensitivity, and that their combined loss reversed their respective individual effects. Our studies show that human YY2 is not redundant to YY1, and YY2 is a significant regulator of genes previously identified as uniquely responding to YY1.", "meta": {"pmid": 20215434}}

However, the prognostic significance of CHD1L in HCC remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the roles of CHD1L in the prognosis of HCC. We investigated the expressions of CHD1L in tumor tissue microarrays of 281 primary HCC patients who underwent surgical resection using immunohistochemistry. Prognostic factors of HCC were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. The median follow-up period was 75.6 months. CHD1L expression was observed in 48 of the 281 HCCs (17.1%). CHD1L expression was associated with a younger age (p=0.033), higher Edmondson grade (p=0.019), microvascular invasion (p<0.001), major portal vein invasion (p=0.037), higher American Joint Committee on Cancer T stage (p=0.001), lower albumin level (p=0.047), and higher \u03b1-fetoprotein level (p=0.002).

Identifying an animal model of T. b. brucei that mimics human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) would enable researchers to study HAT without subjecting themselves to undue risks such as accidental infection. This study assessed the sequential clinical, parasitological and haematological changes in vervet monkeys infected with T. b. brucei. Three vervet monkeys were infected with a 104 inoculum of T. b. brucei (isolate GUTat 1). Late-stage disease was induced by subcurative treatment with diminazene aceturate 28 days post-infection. The animals were treated curatively with melarsoprol upon relapse. Parasitaemia and clinical signs were monitored daily and, at weekly intervals, the monkeys' blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sampled for haematology and parasitosis assessments, respectively. The first-peak parasitaemia was observed between seven and nine days post-infection. Clinical signs associated with the disease included fever, dullness, pallor of mucous membranes, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and oedema. Late-stage signs included stiffness of joints and lethargy. The monkeys developed a disease associated with microcytic hypochromic anaemia. There was an initial decline, followed by an increase, in total white blood cell counts from early- to late-stage disease. Trypanosomes were detected in the CSF and there was a significant increase in white cell counts in the CSF during late-stage disease. Infected vervet monkeys displayed classical clinical symptoms, parasitological and haematological trends that were similar to monkeys infected with T.b. rhodesiense.

As maintenance treatment, it is effective in ulcerative colitis and in some instances also in Crohn's disease. Steroids can be used in active IBD, but their effectiveness as maintenance treatment has never been proven, although in practice low-dose steroids are used for chronic treatment. When the above-mentioned preparations are unsuccessful, other medications could be tried. Flagyl could be used when the colon is involved in Crohn's disease or when anal fistulation develops, but it often fails to maintain its effect after only a few weeks. For refractory IBD more potent immunomodulators are needed. 6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine have been shown to be effective in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease with a response rate between 60 and 70%. Their optimal effect is only reached after 3-4 months. These drugs are therefore not of value for treatment in the acute phase of the disease. 6-Mercaptopurine or azathioprine can be used best in combination with steroids in situations where dose reduction of the latter drug repeatedly leads to relapse. They have therefore a steroid-sparing effect and initiate cessation of the long-term severe side-effects of steroids.

We used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to search for biological functions, pathways, and interrelationships between gene networks. Many of the genes whose activities were affected are involved in cell signaling, cellular development, growth and proliferation, and tissue development.

Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) mitigates against the accumulation of misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins and synaptic dysfunction, which is recognized as an early event in neurodegenerative diseases. Enhanced induction of a set of Hsps in differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells was observed following co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol, compared to their individual application. The dosages employed did not affect cell viability or neuronal process morphology. The induced Hsps included the little studied HSPA6 (Hsp70B'), a potentially neuroprotective protein that is present in the human genome but not in rat and mouse and hence is missing in current animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Enhanced induction of HSPA1A (Hsp70-1), DNAJB1 (Hsp40), HO-1 (Hsp32), and HSPB1 (Hsp27) was also observed. Celastrol activates heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of Hsp gene transcription, and also exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Arimoclomol is a co-activator that prolongs the binding of activated HSF1 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of inducible Hsp genes. Elevated Hsp levels peaked at 10 to 12\u00a0h for HSPA6, HSPA1A, DNAJB1, and HO-1 and at 24\u00a0h for HSPB1. Co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol induced higher Hsp levels compared to heat shock paired with arimoclomol.

We investigated the role of CAFs and hypoxia in breast cancer aggressiveness, and examined the effect of GPER in CAFs on hypoxia-driven breast cancer progression. The results showed that hypoxia upregulated HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs, and induced the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in CAFs. However, GPER silencing abrogated the above hypoxia-driven cytokine expression in CAFs. Moreover, knockdown of GPER in CAFs suppressed breast cancer cell invasion induced by CAF conditioned media (CM). Furthermore, GPER silencing in CAFs inhibited hypoxia-increased CTGF expression in CAFs and breast cancer cells cultured with CM from CAFs under hypoxic conditions. In addition, CTGF is responsible for the observed effects of GPER on CAFs activation and breast cancer invasion.

Here, by lncRNA microarray, we identified 1414 differentially expressed lncRNAs, among which THAP7-AS1 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues compared with non-tumorous gastric tissues. High expression of THAP7-AS1 was correlated with positive lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis. SP1, a transcription factor, could bind directly to the THAP7-AS1 promoter region and activate its transcription. Moreover, the m6A modification of THAP7-AS1 by METTL3 enhanced its expression depending on the \"reader\" protein IGF2BP1-dependent pathway. THAP7-AS1 promoted GC cell progression. Mechanistically, THAP7-AS1 interacted with the 1-50 Amino Acid Region (nuclear localization signal) of CUL4B through its 1-442 nt Sequence, and it promoted interaction between nuclear localization signal (NLS) and importin \u03b11, and improved the CUL4B protein entry into the nucleus, repressing miR-22-3p and miR-320a expression by CUL4B-catalyzed H2AK119ub1 and the EZH2-mediated H3K27me3, subsequently activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote GC progression.

The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal.

We looked for an association between the Val279Phe mutation and schizophrenia in 191 Japanese patients with schizophrenia and in 188 Japanese controls.

{"text": "Stanniocalcin (STC) is a calcium- and phosphate-regulating hormone produced in bony fish by the corpuscles of Stannius, which are located close to the kidney. It is a major antihypercalcemic hormone in fish. As the corpuscles of Stannius are absent, and antihypercalcemic hormones are basically not necessary, in mammals, the discovery of a mammalian homolog, STC1, was surprising and intriguing. STC1 displays a relatively high amino acid sequence identity (approximately 50%) with fish STC. In contrast to fish STC, STC1 is expressed in many tissues, including kidney. More recently, a human gene encoding the second stanniocalcin-like protein, STC2, was identified. STC2 has a lower identity (approximately 35%) with STC1 and fish STC. Similar to STC1, STC2 is also expressed in a variety of tissues. Research into the functions of STCs in mammals is still at an early stage, and the ultimate physiological and pathological roles of STCs have not yet been established. A few studies indicate that STC1, similar to fish STC, stimulates phosphate absorption in the kidney and intestine, but the function of STC2 is still unknown. However, several interesting findings have been reported on their cellular localization, gene structure, and expression in different physiological and pathological conditions, which will be clues in elucidating the functions of STCs in mammals. STC1 expression is enhanced by hypertonicity in a kidney cell line or by ischemic injuries and neural differentiation in the brain. STC1 expression in the ovary is also enhanced during pregnancy and lactation. Calcitriol upregulates STC1 and downregulates STC2 expression in the kidney. Interestingly, STC1 and STC2 are expressed in many tumor cell lines, and the expression of STC2 is enhanced by estradiol in breast cancer cells. STC2 is also expressed in pancreatic islets. These results suggest that the biological repertoires of STCs in mammals will be considerably larger than in fish and may not be limited to mineral metabolism. This brief review describes recent progress in mammalian STC research.", "meta": {"pmid": 11832417}}
{"text": "Select single-nucleotide variants in planar cell polarity (PCP) genes are associated with increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). However, whether copy number variants (CNVs) in PCP genes contribute to NTDs is unknown. Considering that CNVs are implicated in several human developmental disorders, we hypothesized that CNVs in PCP genes may be causative factors to human NTDs. DNA from umbilical cord tissues of NTD-affected fetuses and parental venous blood samples were collected. We performed a quantitative analysis of copy numbers of all exon regions in the VANGL1, VANGL2, CELSR1, SCRIB, DVL2, DVL3, and PTK7 genes using a CNVplex assay. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out to confirm the results of CNV analysis. As a result, 16 CNVs were identified among the NTDs. Of these CNVs, 5 loci were identified in 11 NTD probands with CNVs involving DVL2 (exons 1-15), VANGL1 (exons 1-7, exon 8), and VANGL2 (exons 5-8, exons 7 and 8). One CNV (DVL2 exons 1-15) was a duplication and the remaining 15 CNVs were deletions. Eleven CNVs were confirmed by qPCR. One de novo CNV in VANGL1 and one DVL2 were detected from two cases. Compared with unaffected control populations in 1000 Genome, ExAC, MARRVEL, DGV, and dbVar databases, the frequencies of de novo deletion in VANGL1 (1.14%) and de novo duplication in DVL2 (0.57%) were significantly higher in our NTD subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This study demonstrates that de novo CNVs in PCP genes, notably deletions in VANGL1 and gains in DVL2, could contribute to the risk of NTDs.", "meta": {"pmid": 32388773}}
{"text": "In this report, we characterize the in vitro pharmacokinetic properties of a new antihistamine, alcaftadine. In addition, we report results from phase 1 studies of several ophthalmic formulations of alcaftadine and examine the pharmacokinetic properties of one formulation in detail. In vitro pharmacology employed a human liver microsome assay combined with index substrates or inhibitors for specific cytochromes. Metabolic fate of (14)C-alcaftadine was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-based separation of parent compound from metabolites. Plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis using (3)H-labeled alcaftadine and (3)H-labeled alcaftadine carboxylic acid metabolite. Relative tolerability (comfort) of 4 concentrations and 3 formulations of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution was assessed in 2 double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, contralateral studies in which formulations were compared to Tears Naturale II (placebo) in normal adult subjects. Data analysis focused on the mean differences in subject-reported drop comfort scores (within each dose level, at each time point) and compared the study-treatment eye with the placebo eye. Pharmacokinetics of alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution were determined in an open-label, single-center study after a single bilateral dose and after 7 days of once-a-day bilateral doses in healthy subjects 18-55 years old. Alcaftadine is not significantly metabolized by microsomal cytochromes, but it is rapidly converted to the carboxylic acid metabolite by one or more cytosolic enzymes. Neither the parent compound nor its carboxylic acid metabolite displayed significant plasma protein binding. Over a range of formulations and concentrations (0.05%-0.5%), alcaftadine was well tolerated and subjects reported little or no discomfort or taste perversion in any treatment group. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that both the parent compound and the carboxylic acid metabolite reach peak serum levels within minutes of administration and fall below detectable levels within 3 h of dosing. Based upon pharmacokinetic and phase 1 studies, the novel antihistamine alcaftadine is an appropriate drug for use as an ophthalmic formulation for prevention and treatment of ocular allergic conditions such as allergic conjunctivitis (alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% was recently approved for use by the FDA). Topical administration of alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile.", "meta": {"pmid": 21314437}}
{"text": "Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a collective term for a heterogenous group of rare, inherited cholestasis syndromes. The number of genes underlying the clinical PFIC phenotype is still increasing. While progressive liver disease and its sequelae such as portal hypertension, pruritus and hepatocellular carcinoma determine transplant-free survival, extrahepatic manifestations may cause relevant morbidity. We performed a literature search for extrahepatic manifestations of PFIC associated with pathogenic gene variants in ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, NR1H4 and MYO5B. To illustrate the extrahepatic symptoms described in the literature, PFIC cases from our centres were revisited. Extrahepatic symptoms are common in PFIC subtypes, where the affected gene is expressed at high levels in other tissues. While most liver-associated complications resolve after successful orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), some extrahepatic symptoms show no response or even worsen after OLT. The spectrum of extrahepatic manifestations in PFIC highlights essential, non-redundant roles of the affected genes in other organs. Extrahepatic features contribute towards low health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and morbidity in PFIC. While OLT is often the only remaining, curative treatment, potential extrahepatic manifestations need to be carefully monitored and addressed.", "meta": {"pmid": 35184362}}

Sanger sequencing verified two Peroxidasin (PXDN) mutations in both sibs--a maternally inherited, nonsense mutation, c.1021C>T predicting p.(Arg341*), and a paternally inherited, 23-basepair deletion causing a frameshift and premature protein truncation, c.2375_2397del23, predicting p.(Leu792Hisfs*67). We re-examined exome data from 20 other patients with structural eye defects and identified two additional PXDN mutations in a sporadic male with bilateral microphthalmia, cataracts and anterior segment dysgenesis--a maternally inherited, frameshift mutation, c.1192delT, predicting p.(Tyr398Thrfs*40) and a paternally inherited, missense substitution that was predicted to be deleterious, c.947\u2009A>C, predicting p.(Gln316Pro). Mutations in PXDN were previously reported in three families with congenital cataracts, microcornea, sclerocornea and developmental glaucoma. The gene is expressed in corneal epithelium and is secreted into the extracellular matrix. Defective peroxidasin has been shown to impair sulfilimine bond formation in collagen IV, a constituent of the basement membrane, implying that the eye defects result because of loss of basement membrane integrity in the developing eye. Our finding of a broader phenotype than previously appreciated for PXDN mutations is typical for exome-sequencing studies, which have proven to be highly effective for mutation detection in patients with atypical presentations.

Significant up-regulation during lactation were observed in genes related to fatty acid (FA) uptake from blood (LPL, CD36), intracellular FA transport (FABP3), intracellular FA activation of long- and short-chain FAs (ACSS1, ACSS2, ACSL1), de novo synthesis (ACACA), desaturation (SCD), triacyglycerol (TAG) synthesis (AGPAT6, GPAM, LPIN1), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2, BTN1A1, XDH), ketone body utilisation (BDH1, OXCT1), and transcription regulation (THRSP, PPARGC1A). In particular, intracellular de novo FA synthesis (ACSS2, ACACA, and FABP3) and TAG synthesis (GPAM, AGPAT6, and LPIN1), whose regulation might be orchestrated as part of the gene network under the control of SERBF1 in the milk fat synthesis process, were more activated compared to levels in dairy cows.

A diagnosis of otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, associated with mutations in FLNA, a gene encoding the cytoskeletal protein filamin A, was considered but discarded due to the severity of micromelia, early lethality, and the presence of generalised osteopenia instead of hyperostosis. The degree of undermodelling and campomelia was reminiscent of another group of conditions that include atelosteogenesis types 1 and 3, caused by mutations in FLNB.

The phenotype overlaps that of the autosomal dominant disorders-Stickler and Marshall syndromes-but can be distinguished by disproportionately short limbs, severe hearing loss, and lack of ocular involvement. In one family with OSMED, a homozygous Gly-->Arg substitution has been described in COL11A2, which codes for the alpha2 chain of type XI collagen. We report seven further families with OSMED. All affected individuals had a remarkably similar phenotype: profound sensorineural hearing loss, skeletal dysplasia with limb shortening and large epiphyses, cleft palate, an extremely flat face, hypoplasia of the mandible, a short nose with anteverted nares, and a flat nasal bridge. We screened affected individuals for mutations in COL11A2 and found different mutations in each family. Individuals from four families, including three with consanguineous parents, were homozygous for mutations. Individuals from three other families, in whom parents were nonconsanguineous, were compound heterozygous. Of the 10 identified mutations, 9 are predicted to cause premature termination of translation, and 1 is predicted to cause an in-frame deletion.

Recent reports suggest that IAHA may delay the need for total knee replacement, with the magnitude of delay proportional to the number of injection series. However, the safety of repeated injection series is reported to vary between commercial products. This report describes a systematic review of safety data on repeated treatment courses of SUPARTZ. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Cochrane database, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and unpublished data. We included all human randomized controlled trials or observational studies with adverse event (AE) data for SUPARTZ in knee osteoarthritis. Two independent reviewers extracted data and evaluated study quality. Data were analyzed separately for the first and subsequent series of injections. The primary sources for repeated-injection data on SUPARTZ were a postmarket registry (N = 7404), 4 prospective studies (N = 127 total), and a retrospective study (N = 220). None of the sources reported increased frequency or severity of AEs with repeated injections. In the registry, 95% of multiple-injection-series patients who reported an AE did so during the first series. None of the AEs was serious, and most resolved spontaneously without medical intervention. The overall adverse event rate after repeat courses of SUPARTZ was 0.008 (95% confidence interval: 0.001-0.055). Multiple courses of SUPARTZ injections appear to be at least as safe, and probably safer, than the first course.

{"text": "Renal cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 actively metabolize arachidonate to metabolism five primary prostanoids: prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2a, prostaglandin I2, thromboxane A2, and prostaglandin D2. These lipid mediators interact with a family of distinct G-protein-coupled prostanoid receptors designated EP, FP, IP, TP, and DP, respectively, which exert important regulatory effects on renal function. The intrarenal distribution of these prostanoid receptors has been mapped and the consequences their activation are being characterized. The FP, TP, and EP1 receptors preferentially couple to increased cell Ca2+. EP2, EP4, DP, and IP receptors stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate, whereas the EP3 receptor preferentially couples to Gi, inhibiting cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation. EP1 and EP3 messenger RNA expression predominate in the collecting duct and thick limb, respectively, where their stimulation reduces sodium chloride and water absorption, promoting natriuresis and diuresis. Interestingly, only a mild change in renal water handling is seen in the EP3 receptor knockout mouse. Although only low levels EP2 receptor messenger RNA are detected in kidney and its precise intrarenal localization is uncertain, mice with targeted disruption of the EP2 receptor display salt-sensitive hypertension, suggesting it also plays an important role in salt excretion. In contrast, EP4 messenger RNA is readily detected in the glomerulus where it may contribute to the regulation of renin release and decrease glomerular resistance. TP receptors are also highly expressed in the glomerulus, where they may increase glomerular vascular resistance. The IP receptor messenger RNA is most highly expressed in the afferent arteriole and it may also modulate renal arterial resistance and renin release. At present there is little evidence for DP receptor expression in the kidney. Together these receptors act as physiologic buffers that protect the kidney from excessive functional changes during periods of physiologic stress. Loss of the combined effects of these receptors contributes to the side effects seen in the setting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration, whereas selective antagonists for these receptors may provide new therapeutic approaches in disease.", "meta": {"pmid": 10654821}}

{"text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with preterm birth (PTB), although the reason underlying this relationship is still unclear. Our objective was to examine DNA methylation patterns of 4 ASD candidate genes in human fetal membranes from spontaneous PTB and uncomplicated term birth. A literature search for genes that have been implicated in ASD yielded 14 candidate genes (OXTR, SHANK3, BCL2, RORA, EN2, RELN, MECP2, AUTS2, NLGN3, NRXN1, SLC6A4, UBE3A, GABA, AFF2) that were epigenetically modified in relation to ASD. DNA methylation in fetal leukocyte DNA in 4 of these genes (OXTR, SHANK3, BCL2, and RORA) was associated with PTB in a previous study. This study evaluated DNA methylation, transcription (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), and translation patterns (immunostaining and Western blot) in fetal membrane from term labor (n\u00a0= 14), term\u00a0not in labor (TNIL; n\u00a0= 29), and spontaneous preterm birth (PTB;\u00a0n\u00a0= 27). Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance; a probability value of < .05 was significant. Higher methylation of the OXTR promoter was seen in fetal membranes from PTB, compared with term labor or TNIL. No other gene showed any methylation differences among groups. Expression of OXTR was not different among groups, but the 70 kDa OXTR protein was seen only in PTB, and immunostaining was more intense in PTB amniocytes than term labor or TNIL. Among the 4 genes that were studied, fetal membranes from PTB demonstrate differences in OXTR methylation and regulation and expression, which suggest that epigenetic alteration of this gene in fetal membrane may likely be indicating an in utero programing of this gene and serve as a surrogate in a subset of PTB.

{"text": "Hermansky-Pudlak type 2 is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding disorders, recurrent infections, and moderate/severe neutropenia. The disease is caused by mutations in the AP3B1 gene encoding for the beta3A subunit of the adaptor protein 3 (AP-3) complex. Because the expression of the beta3A subunit is normally ubiquitous, its deficiency leads to a precise phenotype in cells with a large number of intracellular granules, such as neutrophils, natural killer cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, platelets, and melanocytes. Given the AP-3 deficiency, the lysosomal membrane proteins are not appropriately sorted to the granules but are delivered to plasma membrane with subsequent effects on cell development and differentiation. Missorting of proteins (eg, tyrosinase) in melanocytes and platelets accounts for oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding disorders, respectively. Absence of AP-3 leads to low intracellular content of neutrophil elastase and consequently to neutropenia. Abnormal movement of lytic granules and reduced perforin content in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells account for their respective defects in cytolytic activity. It is likely that the investigation of the physiopathology of Hermansky-Pudlak type 2 syndrome will reveal nonredundant functions of this adaptor protein in the intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins.", "meta": {"pmid": 17931556}}

{"text": "Two consecutive i.c.v. administrations of analgesic doses of mu-opioid receptor agonists lead to a profound desensitisation of the latter receptors; a third dose produced less than 20% of the effect obtained with the first administration. Desensitisation was still effective 24h later. Impairing the activity of Galphaz but not Galphai2 subunits prevented tolerance developing after the administration of three consecutive doses of morphine. Further, the i.c.v. injection of Galphai2 subunits potentiated morphine analgesia and abolished acute tolerance, whereas i.c.v.-administered Galphaz subunits produced a rapid and robust loss of the response to morphine. The RGSZ1 and RGSZ2 proteins selectively deactivate GalphazGTP subunits, and their knockdown increased the effects produced by the first dose of morphine. However, impairing their activity also accelerated tachyphylaxis following successive doses of morphine, and facilitated the development of acute morphine tolerance. In contrast, inhibiting the RGS9-2 proteins, which bind to GalphaoGTP and GalphaiGTP but only weakly deactivates them, preserved the effects of consecutive morphine doses and abolished the generation of acute tolerance. Therefore, desensitisation of mu-opioid receptors can be achieved by reducing the responsiveness of post-receptor elements (via the possible action of activated Galphaz subunits) and/or by depleting the pool of receptor-regulated G proteins that agonists need to propagate their effects, e.g., through the activity of RGS9-2 proteins.", "meta": {"pmid": 15617734}}

This study was designed to identify proteins involved in the anticancer activity of curcumin in androgen-dependent (22Rv1) and -independent (PC-3) human prostate cancer cell lines using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Out of 425 differentially expressed spots, we describe here the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of 192 spots of interest, selected by their expression profile. This approach allowed the identification of 60 differentially expressed proteins (32 in 22Rv1 cells and 47 in PC-3 cells). Nineteen proteins are regulated in both cell lines. Further bioinformatic analysis shows that proteins modulated by curcumin are implicated in protein folding (such as heat-shock protein PPP2R1A; RNA splicing proteins RBM17, DDX39; cell death proteins HMGB1 and NPM1; proteins involved in androgen receptor signaling, NPM1 and FKBP4/FKBP52), and that this compound could have an impact on miR-141, miR-152, and miR-183 expression.

SUR2A was the most abundant subunit expressed in all muscles, whereas the vascular SUR2B subunit was expressed but at lower levels.

Also, these tumors may metabolically reprogram to express ASS1, transforming them from an auxotrophic phenotype to a prototrophic phenotype and thus rendering ADI-PEG20 ineffective. Due to these limitations of ADI-PEG20 treatment and the potential for developing resistance, non-invasive tools to monitor sensitivity to arginine starvation are needed. Methods: Within this study, we assess the utility of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer to determine sarcomas reliant on extracellular arginine for survival by measuring changes in amino acid transport in arginine auxotrophic sarcoma cells treated with ADI-PEG20. The uptake of the 18F-labeled histidine analogue, (S)-2-amino-3-[1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-1H-[1,2,3]triazol-4-yl]propanoic acid (AFETP), was assessed in vitro and in vivo using human-derived sarcoma cell lines. In addition, we examined the expression and localization of cationic amino acid transporters in response to arginine starvation with ADI-PEG20. Results: In vitro studies revealed that in response to ADI-PEG20 treatment, arginine auxotrophs increase the uptake of L-[3H]arginine and [18F]AFETP due to an increase in the expression and localization to the plasma membrane of the cationic amino acid transporter CAT-1. Furthermore, in vivo PET imaging studies in mice with arginine-dependent osteosarcoma xenografts showed increased [18F]AFETP uptake in tumors 4 days after ADI-PEG20 treatment compared to baseline. Conclusion: CAT-1 transporters localizes to the plasma membrane as a result of arginine starvation with ADI-PEG20 in ASS1-deficient tumor cells and provides a mechanism for using cationic amino acid transport substrates such as [18F]AFETP for identifying tumors susceptible to ADI-PEG20 treatment though non-invasive PET imaging techniques. These findings indicate that [18F]AFETP-PET may be suitable for the early detection of tumor response to arginine depletion due to ADI-PEG20 treatment.", "meta": {"pmid": 29721066}}
{"text": "The nalorphine (pupil) test for narcotic abuse is widely used in California. It is based on the ability of nalorphine to produce mydriasis in subjects who have recently taken morphine-like drugs and to produce miosis in others. The test will usually detect as little as 15 mg of morphine or comparable doses of other narcotics for several hours except in special circumstances. It is even more reliable for detection of chronic use of narcotics. A simple card pupillometer is adequate for measuring changes in pupil size resulting from nalorphine. Analysis for narcotics in urine by thin layer chromatography is also used, either alone or in conjunction with the pupil test, to detect drug abuse. In one study which included many urine speciments from subjects who had negative pupil tests the correlation between the pupil test and urinalysis was good (85 percent). When urinalysis was used to confirm suspicion of drug use resulting from a positive or equivocal pupil test, inter-method agreement dropped to about 50 percent for various reasons. Even so, use of the pupil test for screening and urinalysis for confirmation provides a satisfactory program for detection of narcotic abuse.", "meta": {"pmid": 5673987}}
{"text": "Hyperparathyroidism is an alteration of the pathophysiological parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion due or an independent and abnormal release (primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) by the parathyroid or an alteration of calcium homeostasis that stimulates the excessive production of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism). There is not a standard, clinical or surgical, treatment for hyperparathyroidism. We review current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. In secondary hyperparathyroidism (2HPT) there is a progressive hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands and an increased production of parathyroid hormone. Several causes are proposed: chronic renal insufficiency, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption syndrome. The tertiary hyperparathyroidism (3HPT) is considered a state of excessive autonomous secretion of PTH due to long-standing 2HPT and it's usually the result of a lack of suppression in the production of PTH. The pathophysiological implications are both skeletal and extraskeletal: it damages the cardiovascular system, nervous system, immune, hematopoietic and endocrine system. The introduction of new drugs has improved the survival of these patients, allowing the inhibition of the synthesis of PTH. Indication for surgical treatment is unresponsive medical therapy. There are no large prospective studies that comparing the medical and surgical treatment.

This disease occurs either in an peracute way, leading to mortality even before clinical signs are observed or in a sub-acute way, characterized by rhomboidal skin lesions, that can be treated with penicillin or its derivatives. Commercial swine vaccines, containing inactivated serotype 2 strains, are currently used for vaccination but it is not known whether these vaccines induce protection against E. rhusiopathiae isolates from dolphins. In the present study, it was demonstrated in a mouse model that vaccination with a commercial swine vaccine (Eurovac Ery, Eurovet, Belgium) containing inactivated serotype 2 E. rhusiopathiae strains induced protection against challenge with three E. rhusiopathiae isolates from dolphins. The duration of the protection varied, depending on the challenging isolate, between 8 and >23 weeks.

{"text": "The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the transcript encoding the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key regulatory sequence that determines the amount of intracellular APP holoprotein present in brain derived cells. Using neuroblastoma cells (SY5Y) we developed a transfection based screen of a library of FDA drugs to identify compounds that limited APP luciferase reporter expression translated from the APP 5'UTR. Paroxetine (Paxil trade mark ), dimercaptopropanol, phenserine, desferrioxamine, tetrathiolmobdylate, and azithromycin were six leads that were subsequently found to also suppress APP holoprotein levels or to alter APP cleavage (azithromycin). Since APP holoprotein levels are proportionate to Abeta peptide output in many systems we tested the efficacy of paroxetine and dimercaptopropanol to limit Abeta secretion as measured by ELISA assays. Paroxetine and dimercaptopropanol limited Abeta peptide secretion from lens epithelial cells (B3 cells). Interestingly, paroxetine changed the steady-state levels of transferrin receptor mRNAs. These data suggested that this serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) provided extra pharmacological action to chelate interacellular iron or change the intracellular iron distribution.

At death (gd 20), all live fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. At 500 and 800 mg/kg/day, maternal toxicity included reduced food consumption during treatment and for the gestation period, increased water consumption in the posttreatment period, reduced weight gain during treatment, and sedation; water consumption was reduced during treatment and for the gestation period, and maternal mortality (17.1%) was observed only at the high dose. Developmental toxicity included reduced prenatal viability (800 mg/kg/day) and reduced fetal body weight/litter (500 and 800 mg/kg/day). In addition, reduced ossification of metacarpals (800 mg/kg/day), phalanges of the forelimbs (500 and 800 mg/kg/day), and of caudal vertebral centra (all doses) was observed. No increase in percent malformed live fetuses/litter was observed. The proportion of litters with one or more malformed fetuses was higher than vehicle controls only at 800 mg/kg/day, with short 13th rib (to which the test species is predisposed) as the predominant observation. By contrast, a positive control agent (nitrofen, 50 mg/kg/day, po, 14 dams) produced 85% malformed fetuses/litter with the predominant malformation being diaphragmatic hernia.

{"text": "The Pax6 genes encode evolutionary conserved transcription factors that act high up in the regulatory hierarchy controlling development of central organs such as the eyes and the central nervous system. These proteins contain two DNA-binding domains. The N-terminal paired domain is separated from a paired-type homeodomain by a linker region, and a transactivation domain is located C-terminal to the homeodomain. Vertebrate Pax6 genes express a paired-less isoform of Pax6 (Pax6DeltaPD) from an internal start codon in the coding region between the paired domain and homeodomain. We now provide evidence for an interaction between the full-length isoform and Pax6DeltaPD, which enhances the transactivation activity of Pax6 from paired domain-binding sites. The paired-like homeodomain protein Rax behaved similarly to Pax6DeltaPD. Both Pax6DeltaPD and Rax bound to the homeodomain of Pax6 in vitro in the absence of specific DNA binding. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments following cotransfection confirmed the existence of complexes between Pax6 and Pax6DeltaPD, Pax6 and Rax, and Pax6DeltaPD and Rax in vivo. Interestingly, the C-terminal subdomain of the paired domain and the homeodomain can interact with each other. The paired domain can also interact with itself. Surprisingly, GST pull-down assays revealed that the homeodomains of such diverse proteins as Chx10, Six3, Lhx2, En-1, Prep1, Prox1, and HoxB1 could all bind to Pax6, and several of these enhanced Pax6-mediated transactivation upon coexpression. Since many homeodomain proteins are coexpressed with Pax6 in several tissues during development, our results indicate the existence of novel regulatory interactions that may be important for fine tuning of gene regulation.", "meta": {"pmid": 11069920}}

The expression level of Bex2 is markedly increased in glioma tissues. We observed that Bex2 over-expression promotes cell proliferation, while down-regulation of Bex2 inhibits cell growth.

{"text": "Src-family tyrosine kinases, which are expressed in various cell types, play critical roles in cell signalling at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane through their lipid modifications. Src-family kinases are cotranslationally myristoylated and posttranslationally palmitoylated in the amino-terminal region. The Src-family member Lyn contains a myristoylation site at glycine-2 and a palmitoylation site at cysteine-3, whereas c-Src has a myristoylation site at glycine-2 but not any palmitoylation sites. However, little is known about the role for lipid modifications of Src-family kinases in cell division. Here, we show that non-lipid-modified Lyn and c-Src, Lyn(G2A/C3A) and c-Src(G2A), are delocalized from membranes to the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which gives rise to a significant increase in the rate of chromosome missegregation, such as chromosome lagging and anaphase chromosome bridging, in a tyrosine kinase activity-dependent manner. Treatment with the Src inhibitor PP2 shows that the kinase activity of non-lipid-modified, non-membrane-bound Src during M phase is critical for giving rise to chromosome missegregation. Given that only a fraction of Src-family kinases fails in lipid modifications during biosynthesis, these results suggest that Src's membrane anchorage through their lipid modifications from prophase to anaphase plays a protective role against induction of chromosome missegregation.", "meta": {"pmid": 27941902}}
{"text": "Saquinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor with no, or limited, effect on the activity of other structurally related human aspartic proteinases. As with other HIV protease inhibitors, saquinavir inhibits the cleavage of the gag-pol protein substrate leading to the release of structurally defective and functionally inactive viral particles. It is active on both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and also has activity on chronically infected cells and HIV strains resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Synergy of action has been observed with other antiretroviral drugs. Saquinavir is characterised by a low bioavailability which is further reduced in the fasting state. Metabolism is mainly hepatic through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, but intestinal metabolism through the same system has also been reported. To achieve higher drug plasma concentrations and increase the antiviral effect, a new formulation of saquinavir with a higher bioavailability has recently been introduced. Higher plasma drug concentrations may also be obtained by combining the drug with CYP blockers, such as ritonavir or ketoconazole. Because of its metabolic interference with the CYP system, saquinavir cannot be coadministered with astemizole, terfenadine or cisapride. Rifampicin (rifampin) is also contraindicated because coadministration can lead to decreases in saquinavir concentrations. Interactions have also been reported with other drugs metabolised through the same system, including non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and HIV protease inhibitors. Resistance has been observed after both in vitro and in vivo drug exposure, with a relatively specific mutation profile compared with other protease inhibitors. Saquinavir is generally well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal symptoms representing the most commonly observed adverse effects. Although characterized by low bioavailability, in phase III trials saquinavir has been shown to have clinical efficacy in terms of survival and progression rate. As with the other protease inhibitors, saquinavir should be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Current therapeutic guidelines, however, recommend the selection of an initial treatment regimen with other protease inhibitors with higher in vivo activity in terms of RNA and CD4 response. The results of ongoing studies will clarify to what extent a new saquinavir formulation, recently introduced, is superior to the previous one in terms of antiviral activity and to provide comparisons with other protease inhibitors.

{"text": "Formation of foam cells is a hallmark at the initial stages of atherosclerosis. Monocytes attracted by pro-inflammatory stimuli attach to the inflamed vascular endothelium and penetrate to the arterial intima where they differentiate to macrophages. Intimal macrophages phagocytize oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). Several scavenger receptors (SR), including CD36, SR-A1 and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), mediate oxLDL uptake. In late endosomes/lysosomes of macrophages, oxLDL are catabolysed. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses cholesterol esters that are enriched in LDL to free cholesterol and free fatty acids. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) in turn catalyses esterification of cholesterol to store cholesterol esters as lipid droplets in the ER of macrophages. Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolases nCEH and NCEH1 are involved in a secondary hydrolysis of cholesterol esters to liberate free cholesterol that could be then out-flowed from macrophages by cholesterol ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and SR-BI.

{"text": "Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) trims antigenic peptide precursors to generate mature antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules and regulates adaptive immune responses. ERAP1 has been proposed to trim peptide precursors both in solution and in preformed MHCI-peptide complexes, but which mode is more relevant to its biological function remains controversial. Here, we compared ERAP1-mediated trimming of antigenic peptide precursors in solution or when bound to three MHCI alleles, HLA-B*58, HLA-B*08, and HLA-A*02. For all MHCI-peptide combinations, peptide binding onto MHCI protected against ERAP1-mediated trimming. In only a single MHCI-peptide combination, trimming of an HLA-B*08-bound 12-mer progressed at a considerable rate, albeit still slower than in solution. Results from thermodynamic, kinetic, and computational analyses suggested that this 12-mer is highly labile and that apparent on-MHC trimming rates are always slower than that of MHCI-peptide dissociation. Both ERAP2 and leucine aminopeptidase, an enzyme unrelated to antigen processing, could trim this labile peptide from preformed MHCI complexes as efficiently as ERAP1. A pseudopeptide analogue with high affinity for both HLA-B*08 and the ERAP1 active site could not promote the formation of a ternary ERAP1/MHCI/peptide complex. Similarly, no interactions between ERAP1 and purified peptide-loading complex were detected in the absence or presence of a pseudopeptide trap. We conclude that MHCI binding protects peptides from ERAP1 degradation and that trimming in solution along with the dynamic nature of peptide binding to MHCI are sufficient to explain ERAP1 processing of antigenic peptide precursors.", "meta": {"pmid": 32184355}}
{"text": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in alleviating the symptoms of depression. However, clinical improvement is only obtained after several weeks of treatment. SSRIs, when administered acutely to animals, have little effect on synaptic levels of serotonin. This suggests the existence of one or more regulatory mechanisms controlling serotonergic neurotransmission. The firing rate of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons is under the control of somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptors, the release of serotonin from nerve terminals is under the control of 5-HT autoreceptors (5-HT1B subtype in rodents, 5-HT1D in other species), whereas the control of the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of serotonin synthesis, is complex, involving 5-HT1A but possibly other 5-HT receptors including the 5-HT1B/D subtype. During prolonged administration with a SSRI, these three feedback systems become desensitized and their regulatory effects on serotonergic neurotransmission are weakened or lost. This has the effect of allowing the synaptic levels of serotonin to rise with a consequently increased stimulation of one or more types of postsynaptic 5-HT receptor. Thus, it is only after prolonged administration that the pharmacological activity of SSRI is fully expressed in terms of synaptic serotonin levels. This may explain the latency of antidepressant action seen with these drugs in humans. Various other classes of antidepressant therapies (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs, electroconvulsive therapy) have long-term effects on one or more of the feedback mechanisms such that an increase in synaptic concentrations of serotonin may be a common mechanism of many antidepressant therapies.", "meta": {"pmid": 8221701}}

{"text": "WASp family proteins serve as conserved regulators of branched microfilament array formation via the Arp2/3 actin polymerization machinery. We have identified a specific role during spermatogenesis for the Drosophila WASp homolog (Wsp) and associated elements. Spermatogenesis within the fly testis is carried out in cysts, where a pair of somatic cyst cells encloses differentiating sperm. The final phase of the process involves the attachment of matured cysts to a specialized epithelium at the base of the testis, followed by release of individual motile spermatids into the adjoining seminal vesicle. Wsp mutant cysts contain fully mature sperm, but spermatid release does not occur, resulting in male sterility. Our data suggest that the Wsp-Arp2/3-based machinery acts in the cyst cells to influence proper microfilament organization and to enable cyst attachment to the base of the testis. Wsp activity in this context is mediated by the small GTPase Cdc42. Involvement of the cell surface protein Sticks and stones and the Wsp adapter protein D-WIP (Vrp1) is also crucial. In parallel, we demonstrate that N-WASp (Wasl), the major mammalian WASp family protein, is required in the somatic Sertoli cells of the mouse testis for sperm maturation.

{"text": "To detect the underlying genetic defects in two autosomal dominant congenital cataract (ADCC) families, having respectively twenty and four members affected with bilateral congenital cataract. Detailed family history and clinical data were recorded. Mutation screening in twenty three candidate genes including crystallins (CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYBA1/A3, CRYBA2, CRYBA4, CRYBB1, CRYBB2, CRYBB3, CRYGA, CRYGB, CRYGC, CRYGD, and CRYGS), gap junctional channels; connexins (GJA8, GJA3), beaded filament chain proteins (BFSP1, BFSP2), major intrinsic protein (MIP), lens intrinsic membrane protein-2 (LIM2), transcriptional factor (MAF), and in genes encoding for membrane-associated proteins (TMEM114, CHMP4B, EPHA2) was performed by bi-directional sequence analysis of the amplified products. In family A twenty members in six generations were affected by bilateral aculeiform type cataract and in family B four affected members in three generations had granular nuclear cataract. Mutation screening in already known candidate genes by sequence analyses revealed proline to threonine substitution at codon 23 (p.Pro23Thr) in CRYGD for aculeiform type cataract in family A. The family B with four members affected by granular nuclear cataract, however, could not be linked with any of these analyzed 23 candidate genes. The present study describes identification of p.Pro23Thr mutation in CRYGD for aculeiform type cataract in an ADCC family of Indian origin. The identical mutation has previously been reported to be linked with different phenotypes; lamellar cataract, cerulean cataract, coralliform cataract, flaky silica-like nuclear cataract and fasciculiform type cataract in different ADCC families. Interestingly, a mutation of different codon, i.e., p.Arg58His in CRYGD has been reported to be linked with aculeiform cataract in four different families; two from Switzerland, one from Macedonia and in a Mexican family. The findings in present study thus expand the genetic heterogeneity for aculeiform type cataract. Further, exclusion of these twenty three known candidate genes in family B having ADCC of granular nuclear type indicates the role of some other gene apart from for crystallins, gap junction channels, beaded filaments and membrane-associated proteins, and MAF for this phenotype.", "meta": {"pmid": 22669729}}

This part of the study describes the development of a powder formulation with colistin sulfate as model substance. The aim of the new dosage form was to increase pulmonary deposition, therapeutic efficiency and, by that, compliance by the CF patients. A physical powder mixture of colistin and a size fraction of lactose (106-150 microm) was prepared and the mixture was optimized with respect to colistin content (83.3%) for use in a special test inhaler. A laser diffraction apparatus with special inhaler adapter was applied for analysis of the size distribution of the aerosol cloud from the inhaler. The size distributions of the aerosol clouds from the test inhaler at flow rates between 30 and 60 l/min for the optimized formulation showed nearly the same median diameter as that for the primary drug particles. But the X(100)-value was much lower, because of an effective large particle separation from the inspiratory air by an air classifier in the test inhaler. The results suggest that dry powder inhalation might be a suitable and highly efficient alternative for nebulization of antibiotic drugs in CF therapy.", "meta": {"pmid": 12084498}}

Sixty specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: a model group (MG) and a control group (CG). In the MG group, nephropathy was induced by unilateral nephrectomy and a single tail vein injection of adriamycin (5 mg/kg). Ten rats were sacrificed every 2 weeks in each group. The expressions of smooth muscle alpha actin (alpha-SMA), collagen (COL)-IV, STAT1, and STAT3 were examined using histochemical techniques, and Western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of STAT1, STAT3, phosphorylated (P)-STAT1, P-STAT3, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta(1)). The expressions of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1, SOCS3, protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS)1, and PIAS3 were also measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. A steady and significant increase in the expressions of alpha-SMA, COL-IV and TGFbeta(1) were observed in MG rats over the whole experimental course. Increased STAT1 and P-STAT1 levels in MG rats were observed by week 6, whereas increased levels of STAT3 and P-STAT3 were noted by week 2. At the mRNA levels, JAK1, STAT1, and PIAS1 were significantly increased in MG rats in week 2, whereas JAK2 mRNA showed a significant decrease by weeks 2 and 4, followed by an significant increase in week 6. Significantly increased STAT3 levels were noted in week 2, followed by a steady and significant decrease in weeks 4 and 6. Significantly reduced levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS3 mRNA were noted at all time points.

Although fisetin can inhibit kidney cancer, its effects on kidney renal stem cells (HuRCSCs) remain unknown. Our study found that renal cancer tissues and CD44+/CD105+ HuRCSCs both show high TET1 protein expression. Both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro experiments showed that fisetin can effectively inhibit HuRCSC cell division and proliferation, invasion, in\u00a0vivo tumourigenesis and angiogenesis. Our findings showed that fisetin can significantly decrease TET1 expression levels in HuRCSCs and overall 5hmC levels in the genomes of these cells. At the same time, ChIP-PCR results showed that fisetin can effectively inhibit 5hmC modification levels at the CpG islands in cyclin Y (CCNY) and CDK16 and reduce their transcription and activity. Thus, we conclude that fisetin inhibits the epigenetic mechanism in renal cancer stem cells, that is, fisetin inhibits TET1 expression and reduces 5hmC modification in specific loci in the promoters of CCNY/CDK16 in HuRSCs.

Lidocaine and tocainide were administered intravenously (average plasma concentration of lidocaine 6 mol X L-1 and of tocainide 20 mol X L-1).

{"text": "Mutations in the GDAP1 gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy. GDAP1 is an atypical glutathione S-transferase (GST) of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the mitochondrial membrane contacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (MAMs). Here, we investigate the role of this GST in the autophagic flux and the membrane contact sites (MCSs) between mitochondria and lysosomes in the cellular pathophysiology of GDAP1 deficiency. We demonstrate that GDAP1 participates in basal autophagy and that its depletion affects LC3 and PI3P biology in autophagosome biogenesis and membrane trafficking from MAMs. GDAP1 also contributes to the maturation of lysosome by interacting with PYKfyve kinase, a pH-dependent master lysosomal regulator. GDAP1 deficiency causes giant lysosomes with hydrolytic activity, a delay in the autophagic lysosome reformation, and TFEB activation. Notably, we found that GDAP1 interacts with LAMP-1, which supports that GDAP1-LAMP-1 is a new tethering pair of mitochondria and lysosome membrane contacts. We observed mitochondria-lysosome MCSs in soma and axons of cultured mouse embryonic motor neurons and human neuroblastoma cells. GDAP1 deficiency reduces the MCSs between these organelles, causes mitochondrial network abnormalities, and decreases levels of cellular glutathione (GSH). The supply of GSH-MEE suffices to rescue the lysosome membranes and the defects of the mitochondrial network, but not the interorganelle MCSs nor early autophagic events. Overall, we show that GDAP1 enables the proper function of mitochondrial MCSs in both degradative and nondegradative pathways, which could explain primary insults in GDAP1-related CMT pathophysiology, and highlights new redox-sensitive targets in axonopathies where mitochondria and lysosomes are involved.", "meta": {"pmid": 33372681}}

Furthermore, the clinical features of these patients were also studied. The results showed that the DNMT3a mutation were detected in 7 out of 59 patients with de novo AML (11.9%), which included 4 patients with DNMT3a R882C, 2 patients with DNMT3a R882H and 1 patient with DNMT3a Y874C. Morphology examination indicated that 2 patients were M(2), 1 patient was M(4) and 4 patients were M(5). Cytogenetic analysis revealed that karyotype in 5 out of 7 patients with DNMT3a mutation were normal. In total of 27 patients with normal karyotype 5 patients (22.7%) were found harboring DNMT3a mutation, while no DNMT3a mutation was found in 21 patients with abnormal karyotype. The mutation rate in patients with positive CEBPA was obviously higher than that in patients with negative CEBPA (p = 0.002).

{"text": "Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) catalyzes the first step of hypusination of the elongation translation factor 5A (eIF5A), and these two proteins have an exclusive enzyme-substrate relationship. Here we demonstrate that DHPS has a role independent of eIF5A hypusination in A375 and SK-MEL-28 human melanoma cells, in which the extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway is deregulated. We found that RNA interference of DHPS induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in association with increased p21CIP1 expression in these cells whereas eIF5A knockdown induces cell death without increasing p21CIP1 expression. Interestingly, p21CIP1 knockdown switched DHPS knockdown-induced growth arrest to cell death in these cells, suggesting a specific relation between DHPS and p21CIP1 in determining cell fate. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of DHPS-K329R mutant that cannot hypusinate eIF5A abrogated DHPS knockdown-induced p21CIP1 expression in these cells, suggesting a non-canonical role of DHPS underlying the contrasting effects of DHPS and eIF5A knockdowns. We also show that DHPS knockdown induces p21CIP1 expression in these cells by increasing CDKN1A transcription through TP53 and SP1 in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. These data suggest that DHPS has a role independent of its ability to hypusinate eIF5A in cells, which appears to be important for regulating p21CIP1 expression and cell fate.", "meta": {"pmid": 34947982}}
{"text": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and shows high heritability. However, how inherited variants contribute to ASD in multiplex families remains unclear. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a family with three affected children, we identified multiple inherited DNA variants in ASD-associated genes and pathways (RELN, SHANK2, DLG1, SCN10A, KMT2C and ASH1L). All are shared among the three children, except ASH1L, which is only present in the most severely affected child. The compound heterozygous variants in RELN, and the maternally inherited variant in SHANK2, are considered to be major risk factors for ASD in this family. Both genes are involved in neuron activities, including synaptic functions and the GABAergic neurotransmission system, which are highly associated with ASD pathogenesis. DLG1 is also involved in synapse functions, and KMT2C and ASH1L are involved in chromatin organization. Our data suggest that multiple inherited rare variants, each with a subthreshold and/or variable effect, may converge to certain pathways and contribute quantitatively and additively, or alternatively act via a 2nd-hit or multiple-hits to render pathogenicity of ASD in this family. Additionally, this multiple-hits model further supports the quantitative trait hypothesis of a complex genetic, multifactorial etiology for the development of ASDs.", "meta": {"pmid": 34356069}}

As an oligodendroglioma model, we make use of the Hs683 cell line that has been previously extensively characterized at cell biology, molecular biology, and genetic levels. Galectin 1 has been shown to be involved in Hs683 oligodendroglioma chemoresistance, neoangiogenesis, and migration. Down-regulating Gal-1 expression in Hs683 cells through targeted small interfering RNA provokes a marked decrease in the expression of the brain-expressed X-linked gene: BEX2. Accordingly, the potential role of BEX2 in Hs683 oligodendroglioma cell biology has been investigated. The data presented here reveal that decreasing BEX2 expression in Hs683 cells increases the survival of Hs683 orthotopic xenograft-bearing mice. Furthermore, this decrease in BEX2 expression impairs vasculogenic mimicry channel formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, and modulates glioma cell adhesion and invasive features through the modification of several genes previously reported to play a role in cancer cell migration, including MAP2, plexin C1, SWAP70, and integrin beta(6).

Biopsies from 2 patients diagnosed with microvillous inclusion disease at the time of original biopsy demonstrated diffuse CD10-positive cytoplasmic inclusions within enterocytes and normal expression of EpCAM and chromogranin. Biopsies from 3 patients, including 2 siblings with confirmed EPCAM mutations, demonstrated complete loss of EpCAM expression and normal expression of CD10 and chromogranin; electron microscopic evaluation revealed characteristic ultrastructural findings of tufting enteropathy.

A recent genome-wide association study reported several single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the STX6, MOBP, MAPT, and EIF2AK3 in association with PSP. To explore whether these single-nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with AD risk, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the PSP-associated loci in 1592 Han Chinese subjects. Rs242557 at the MAPT locus was associated with late-onset AD (LOAD) (odds ratio [OR], 1.175; p = 0.026), which appeared to be stronger for LOAD patients with apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele (OR, 1.510), and this positive association was not changed after adjusting for age, sex, and the APOE \u03b54-carrier status (additive model: OR, 1.163; p = 0.036; dominant model: OR, 1.315; p = 0.010). Rs1768208 in MOBP and rs7571971 in EIF2AK3 showed association only in the APOE \u03b54 positive subjects, and these did not appear to be independent of APOE. As for rs1411478 in STX6, we did not explore any association with LOAD. Our exploratory analysis mainly suggests an association of MAPT with LOAD, especially in APOE \u03b54 carriers. Genotypes at MOBP and EIF2AK3 confer risk predominantly in APOE \u03b54-positive subjects, with indications of an interaction between APOE and MOBP or EIF2AK3 on AD risk.", "meta": {"pmid": 23116876}}

Here, we report a recessive syndrome associated with PRDM13 mutation. Patients exhibited intellectual disability, ataxia with cerebellar hypoplasia, scoliosis, and delayed puberty with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH). Expression studies revealed Prdm13/PRDM13 transcripts in the developing hypothalamus and cerebellum in mouse and human. An analysis of hypothalamus and cerebellum development in mice homozygous for a Prdm13 mutant allele revealed a significant reduction in the number of Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the hypothalamus and PAX2+ progenitors emerging from the cerebellar ventricular zone. The latter was accompanied by ectopic expression of the glutamatergic lineage marker TLX3. Prdm13-deficient mice displayed cerebellar hypoplasia and normal gonadal structure, but delayed pubertal onset. Together, these findings identify PRDM13 as a critical regulator of GABAergic cell fate in the cerebellum and of hypothalamic kisspeptin neuron development, providing a mechanistic explanation for the cooccurrence of CHH and cerebellar hypoplasia in this syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence linking disrupted PRDM13-mediated regulation of Kiss1 neurons to CHH in humans.", "meta": {"pmid": 34730112}}

To overcome the oxygen-limiting conditions and to circumvent the complex regulation of rhamnolipid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an engineered strain Pseudomonas stutzeri Rhl was constructed for heterologous production of rhamnolipid under anaerobic conditions. The rhlABRI genes for rhamnolipid biosynthesis were cloned into a facultative anaerobic strain Ps. stutzeri DQ1 to construct the engineered strain Rhl. Anaerobic production of rhamnolipid was confirmed by thin layer chromatography and Fourier transform infrared analysis. Rhamnolipid product reduced the air-water surface tension to 30.3 mN m(-1) and the oil-water interfacial tension to 0.169 mN m(-1). Rhl produced rhamnolipid of 1.61 g l(-1) using glycerol as the carbon source. Rhl anaerobic culture emulsified crude oil up to EI24 \u2248 74. An extra 9.8% of original crude oil was displaced by Rhl in the core flooding test. Strain Rhl achieved anaerobic production of rhamnolipid and worked well for enhanced oil recovery in the core flooding model. The rhamnolipid produced by Rhl was similar to that of the donor strain SQ6. This is the first study to achieve anaerobic and heterologous production of rhamnolipid.

Here, we investigated the regulation of HoxC4 transcription by a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) in mouse B cells. APRIL substantially increased both HoxC4 and AID expression, whereas BAFF induced the expression of AID but not HoxC4. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we constructed a HoxC4 gene promoter reporter vector and analyzed the promoter induction after APRIL stimulation. APRIL enhanced the HoxC4 promoter activity by 2.3-fold, and this increase disappeared when the second putative NF-\u03baB-binding promoter element (NBE2) was mutated. Based on ChIP assays, we found that NF-\u03baB bound to the HoxC4 promoter NBE2 region. Furthermore, the overexpression of NF-\u03baB augmented the APRIL-induced HoxC4 promoter activity, while the expression of dominant negative-I\u03baB\u03b1 suppressed it.

{"text": "The involvement of macroautophagy/autophagy proteins in B-cell receptor (BCR) trafficking, although suspected, is not well understood. We show that ATG5 (autophagy related 5) contributes to BCR polarization after stimulation and internalization into LAMP1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1)+ and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)+ compartments. BCR polarization is crucial in the context of immobilized antigen processing. Moreover, antigen presentation to cognate T cells is decreased in the absence of ATG5 when the model antigen OVAL/ovalbumin is provided in an immobilized form in contrast to the normal presentation of soluble OVAL. We further show that ATG5 is required for centrosome polarization and actin nucleation in the immune synapse area. This event is accompanied by an increased interaction between ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16-like 1 [S. cerevisiae]) and the microtubule-organizing center-associated protein PCM1 (pericentriolar material 1). In the human B cell line BJAB, PCM1 is required for BCR polarization after stimulation. We thus propose that the ATG12 (autophagy related 12)-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex under BCR stimulation allows its interaction with PCM1 and consequently facilitates centrosome relocalization to the immune synapse, optimizing the presentation of particulate antigens.

One such strategy is the use of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which circumvent the requirement for some eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Much effort has been directed to unravel the precise mechanism of translation initiation by hepatitis C virus (HCV) mRNA. In the present study, we examined the involvement of several eIFs in HCV IRES-driven translation in human cells in a comparative analysis with mRNAs bearing the encephalomyocarditis virus or the Cricket paralysis virus IRES element. Consistent with previous findings, several inhibitors of eIF2 activity, including sodium arsenite, thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and salubrinal, had no inhibitory effect on the translation of an mRNA bearing the HCV IRES, and all induced the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. In addition, hippuristanol and pateamine A, two known inhibitors of eIF4A, failed to block HCV IRES-directed translation. To test the release of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm and to analyze the formation of stress granules, the location of the nuclear protein TIA1 was tested by immunocytochemistry. Both arsenite and pateamine A could efficiently induce the formation of stress granules containing TIA1 and eIF4G, whereas eIF3 and eIF2 failed to localize to these cytoplasmic bodies. The finding of eIF4A and eIF4G in stress granules suggests that they do not participate in mRNA translation. Human HAP1 cells depleted for eIF2A, eIF2D, or both factors, were able to synthesize luciferase from an mRNA bearing the HCV IRES even when eIF2\u03b1 was phosphorylated. Overall, these results demonstrate that neither eIF2A nor eIF2D does not participate in the translation directed by HCV IRES.

In contrast, the majority of patients with dyshormonogenesis has been linked to mutations in the SLC5A5, SLC26A4, SLC26A7, TPO, DUOX1, DUOX2, DUOXA1, DUOXA2, IYD or TG genes, which usually originate goiter. About 800 genetic mutations have been reported to cause CH in patients so far, including missense, nonsense, in-frame deletion and splice-site variations. Many of these mutations are implicated in specific domains, cysteine residues or glycosylation sites, affecting the maturation of nascent proteins that go through the secretory pathway. Consequently, misfolded proteins are permanently entrapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are translocated to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. Despite of all these remarkable advances in the field of the CH pathogenesis, several points on the development of this disease remain to be elucidated. The continuous study of thyroid gene mutations with the application of new technologies will be useful for the understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms related to CH. In this review we summarize the present status of knowledge on the disorders in the protein folding caused by thyroid genes mutations.", "meta": {"pmid": 31751626}}
{"text": "Calcium signalling was studied in porcine aortic endothelial cells stably transfected with wild type or mutants of the human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) beta-receptor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor-1 (FGFR1). Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma) has a consensus binding site at phosphorylated Tyr1021 in the PDGF beta-receptor. The phosphorylated tyrosine at 1009 is a binding site for Syp/PTP1D, an adaptor molecule mediating Grb2/RAS signalling. Also, Tyr1009 has been shown to be a minor binding site for PLC-gamma; however previous data have indicated that it does not have any functional significance in PLC-gamma signalling. The concentration of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) was measured by microfluorometry and digital imaging. About 72% of the cells transfected with wild type PDGF beta-receptor responded to a challenge with PDGF-BB. Mutants in which both Tyr1009 and Tyr1021 in the PDGF beta-receptor were exchanged for phenylalanine totally lacked [Ca2+]i responses. However, in those with a single mutation at Tyr1009 or Tyr1021, 36% and 12% of the cells responded, respectively. In cells transfected with FGFR1 or FGFchim, with the kinase insert of FGFR1 replaced by the insert of the PDGF beta-receptor, a [Ca2+]i increases was observed in similar proportions of cells. The amplitudes of the growth factor-induced [Ca2+]i responses was comparable in the different transfectants. Thrombin, activating a G-protein coupled receptor, triggered [Ca2+]i peaks more rapidly, and in a higher proportion of cells compared to the growth factors. The present data indicate that both Tyr1009 and Tyr1021 alone and in cooperation mediate PDGF-BB triggered calcium signalling.", "meta": {"pmid": 9673410}}
{"text": "The IFT-B complex mediates ciliary anterograde protein trafficking and membrane protein export together with the BBSome. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is caused by mutations in not only all BBSome subunits, but also in some IFT-B subunits, including IFT74/BBS22 and IFT27/BBS19, which form heterodimers with IFT81 and IFT25, respectively. We found that the IFT25-IFT27 dimer bind the C-terminal region of the IFT74-IFT81 dimer, and that the IFT25-IFT27-binding region encompasses the region deleted in the BBS variants of IFT74. In addition, we found that the missense BBS variants of IFT27 are impaired in IFT74-IFT81 binding, and are unable to rescue the BBS-like phenotypes of IFT27-knockout cells. Furthermore, the BBS variants of IFT74 rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT74-knockout cells, but the rescued cells demonstrated BBS-like abnormal phenotypes. Taken together, we conclude that the impaired interaction between IFT74-IFT81 and IFT25-IFT27 causes the BBS-associated ciliary defects.", "meta": {"pmid": 34888642}}
{"text": "Recent consensus on the definition, phenomenology and classification of dystonia centres around phenomenology and guides our diagnostic approach for the heterogeneous group of dystonias. Current terminology classifies conditions where dystonia is the sole motor feature (apart from tremor) as 'isolated dystonia', while 'combined dystonia' refers to dystonias with other accompanying movement disorders. This review highlights recent advances in the genetics of some isolated and combined dystonic syndromes. Some genes, such as ANO3, GNAL and CIZ1, have been discovered for isolated dystonia, but they are probably not a common cause of classic cervical dystonia. Conversely, the phenotype associated with TUBB4A mutations expanded from that of isolated dystonia to a syndrome of hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC syndrome). Similarly, ATP1A3 mutations cause a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism to alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other entities entailing dystonia-parkinsonism include dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (SLC63 mutations); dopa-responsive dystonias; young-onset parkinsonism (PARKIN, PINK1 and DJ-1 mutations); PRKRA mutations; and X-linked TAF1 mutations, which rarely can also manifest in women. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity also characterizes myoclonus-dystonia, which includes not only the classical phenotype associated with epsilon-sarcoglycan mutations but rarely also presentation of ANO3 gene mutations, TITF1 gene mutations typically underlying benign hereditary chorea, and some dopamine synthesis pathway conditions due to GCH1 and TH mutations. Thus, new genes are being recognized for isolated dystonia, and the phenotype of known genes is broadening and now involves different combined dystonia syndromes. ", "meta": {"pmid": 25643588}}
{"text": "In an attempt to disclose mechanisms of bladder carcinogenesis and discover novel target molecules for development of treatment, we applied a cDNA microarray to screen genes that were significantly transactivated in bladder cancer cells. Among the upregulated genes, we here focused on a novel gene, (DEPDC1) DEP domain containing 1, whose overexpression was confirmed by northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Immunocytochemical staining analysis detected strong staining of endogenous DEPDC1 protein in the nucleus of bladder cancer cells. Since DEPDC1 expression was hardly detectable in any of 24 normal human tissues we examined except the testis, we considered this gene-product to be a novel cancer/testis antigen. Suppression of DEPDC1 expression with small-interfering RNA significantly inhibited growth of bladder cancer cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that DEPDC1 might play an essential role in the growth of bladder cancer cells, and would be a promising molecular-target for novel therapeutic drugs or cancer peptide-vaccine to bladder cancers.", "meta": {"pmid": 17452976}}
{"text": " Type 1 diabetes can be treated by the transplantation of cadaveric whole pancreata or isolated pancreatic islets. However, this form of treatment is hampered by the chronic shortage of cadaveric donors. Embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived insulin producing cells (IPCs) offer a potentially novel source of unlimited cells for transplantation to treat type 1 and possibly type 2 diabetes. However, thus far, the lack of a reliable protocol for efficient differentiation of ES cells into IPCs has hindered the clinical exploitation of these cells. To efficiently generate IPCs using ES cells, we have developed a double transgenic ES cell line R1Pdx1AcGFP/RIP-Luc that constitutively expresses pancreatic \u03b2-cell-specific transcription factor pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (Pdx1) as well as rat insulin promoter (RIP) driven luciferase reporter. We have established several protocols for the reproducible differentiation of ES cells into IPCs. The differentiation of ES cells into IPCs was monitored by immunostaining as well as real-time quantitative RT-PCR for pancreatic \u03b2-cell-specific markers. Pancreatic \u03b2-cell specific RIP became transcriptionally active following the differentiation of ES cells into IPCs and induced the expression of the luciferase reporter. Glucose stimulated insulin secretion by the ES cell-derived IPCs was measured by ELISA. Further, we have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of ES cell-derived IPCs to correct hyperglycemia in syngeneic streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic mice. The long term fate of the transplanted IPCs co-expressing luciferase in syngeneic STZ-induced diabetic mice was monitored by real time noninvasive in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). We have recently demonstrated that spontaneous in vivo differentiation of R1Pdx1AcGFP/RIP-Luc ES cell-derived pancreatic endoderm-like cells (PELCs) into IPCs corrects hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Here, we investigated whether R1Pdx1AcGFP/RIP-Luc ES cells can be efficiently differentiated in vitro into IPCs. Our new data suggest that R1Pdx1AcGFP/RIP-Luc ES cells efficiently differentiate into glucose responsive IPCs. The ES cell differentiation led to pancreatic lineage commitment and expression of pancreatic \u03b2 cell-specific genes, including Pax4, Pax6, Ngn3, Isl1, insulin 1, insulin 2 and PC2/3. Transplantation of the IPCs under the kidney capsule led to sustained long-term correction of hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. Although these newly generated IPCs effectively rescued hyperglycemic mice, an unexpected result was teratoma formation in 1 out of 12 mice. We attribute the development of the teratoma to the presence of either non-differentiated or partially differentiated stem cells. Our data show the potential of Pdx1-engineered ES cells to enhance pancreatic lineage commitment and to robustly drive the differentiation of ES cells into glucose responsive IPCs. However, there is an unmet need for eliminating the partially differentiated stem cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 23369186}}

A patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who developed arthritis secondary to IFN therapy is presented. The clinical features and treatment of this condition in 37 additional cases are reviewed. The most common clinical presentation was symmetric polyarthritis. This was associated with antinuclear antibodies in 72% of patients and rheumatoid factor in 34%. Cessation of IFN, with or without the addition of antiinflammatory or remittive agents, resulted in remission of arthritis in 89% and 71% of the cases, respectively. Restarting IFN therapy resulted in recurrence of arthritis in 63%. In the patient described in this report, recurrence of arthritis was prevented by coadministration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and prednisone. Arthritis is an uncommon complication of IFN therapy; but it may lead to cessation of this treatment modality. In such cases, coadministration of a remittive agent such as HCQ may enable reinstitution of IFN therapy without recurrence of arthritis.", "meta": {"pmid": 9662754}}

We genetically engineered a recombinant MeV armed with a yeast-derived bifunctional suicide gene that encodes for cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (MeV-SCD). From this suicide gene, a chimeric protein is produced that converts the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into highly cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and directly into 5-fluorouridine monophosphate (5-FUMP) thereby bypassing an important mechanism of chemoresistance to 5-FU. MeV-SCD was demonstrated to infect, replicate in and effectively lyse not only human ovarian cancer cell lines, but also primary tumor cells (albeit at lower efficiencies) that were derived from malignant ascites of ovarian cancer patients. Addition of the prodrug 5-FC significantly enhanced cell killing. Importantly, precision-cut tumor slices of human ovarian cancer patient specimens were efficiently infected with MeV-SCD. The prodrug-converting enzyme SCD was expressed by all infected tumor slices, thereby ensuring provision of the suicide gene arming function in patient-derived materials.

{"text": "Tissues with high metabolic rates often use lipids, as well as glucose, for energy, conferring a survival advantage during feast and famine. Current dogma suggests that high-energy-consuming photoreceptors depend on glucose. Here we show that the retina also uses fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation for energy. Moreover, we identify a lipid sensor, free fatty acid receptor 1 (Ffar1), that curbs glucose uptake when fatty acids are available. Very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), which is present in photoreceptors and is expressed in other tissues with a high metabolic rate, facilitates the uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acid. In the retinas of Vldlr(-/-) mice with low fatty acid uptake but high circulating lipid levels, we found that Ffar1 suppresses expression of the glucose transporter Glut1. Impaired glucose entry into photoreceptors results in a dual (lipid and glucose) fuel shortage and a reduction in the levels of the Krebs cycle intermediate \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG). Low \u03b1-KG levels promotes stabilization of hypoxia-induced factor 1a (Hif1a) and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) by starved Vldlr(-/-) photoreceptors, leading to neovascularization. The aberrant vessels in the Vldlr(-/-) retinas, which invade normally avascular photoreceptors, are reminiscent of the vascular defects in retinal angiomatous proliferation, a subset of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is associated with high vitreous VEGFA levels in humans. Dysregulated lipid and glucose photoreceptor energy metabolism may therefore be a driving force in macular telangiectasia, neovascular AMD and other retinal diseases. ", "meta": {"pmid": 26974308}}

{"text": "Relaxin-3 is a recently discovered neuropeptide and the results of earlier anatomical and pharmacological studies suggest it plays a physiological role in modulating functions such as arousal, learning and memory, food intake and neuroendocrine homeostasis. Relaxin-3 is also postulated to modulate affective behaviour, based on high densities of the relaxin-3 G-protein coupled receptor (RXFP3) in brain areas involved in stress and mood/anxiety, including the central amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN); and strong activation of relaxin-3 neurons by stressors, via activation of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 (CRF1). This study assessed the effect of central administration of a newly developed RXFP3-selective agonist, on anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour in rats. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats administered 5 \u03bcg [R3A(11-24,C15\u2192A)B] (referred to as RXFP3-A2), intracerebroventricularly, demonstrated decreased anxiety-like behaviour in the light-dark box and elevated plus maze, but not in the open field. Notably, in the repeat forced swim test, central RXFP3-A2 administration decreased immobility in rats that had been subjected to the 'stress' of former exposure to the anxiety tests, but not in experimentally na\u00efve rats. These data implicate relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling in the modulation of effects of acute (anxiety) and cumulative (depression) neurogenic stressors on behaviour; and suggest a potential for RXFP3 agonists as anxiolytic and anti-depressant agents.

{"text": "Definition of virulent Streptococcus suis strains is controversial. One successful approach for identification of virulent European strains is differentiation of capsular serotypes (or the corresponding cps types) and subsequent detection of virulence-associated factors, namely the extracellular factor (EF, epf), the muramidase-released protein (MRP, mrp) and the hemolysin suilysin (SLY, sly). In this work we present a novel multiplex PCR (MP-PCR) and an mrp variant PCR for identification and characterization of virulent S. suis strains. These new methods were used to identify association of disease with particular profiles of virulence-associated genes. The MP-PCR allowed identification of S. suis through detection of the housekeeping gene gdh, differentiation of four cps types (1, 2, 7 and 9), and detection of epf, mrp, sly and arcA (arginine deiminase from S. suis). Furthermore, this study describes the first PCR assay for differentiation of at least six mrp variants. Expression of the corresponding size variants of MRP was shown for four of the six mrp variants, but was undetectable for the two larger mrp variants in the particular strains investigated. The results of this study suggest that cps7 strains are associated with pneumonia and that variation of mrp is very pronounced among these strains. Gene profiles of invasive, pneumonia and carrier S. suis isolates by combination of PCR assays allowed differentiation of 24 different genotypes among cps1, 2, 7 and 9 strains. Forty-five percent of the invasive S. suis diseases investigated in this study were caused by only two of these genotypes, namely cps2/mrp+/epf+/sly+ and cps9/mrp(*)/epf-/sly+.

{"text": "CAPS (aka CADPS) is required for optimal vesicle exocytosis in neurons and endocrine cells where it functions to prime the exocytic machinery for Ca(2+)-triggered fusion. Fusion is mediated by trans complexes of the SNARE proteins VAMP-2, syntaxin-1, and SNAP-25 that bridge vesicle and plasma membrane. CAPS promotes SNARE complex formation on liposomes, but the SNARE binding properties of CAPS are unknown. The current work revealed that CAPS exhibits high affinity binding to syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 and moderate affinity binding to VAMP-2. CAPS binding is specific for a subset of exocytic SNARE protein isoforms and requires membrane integration of the SNARE proteins. SNARE protein binding by CAPS is novel and mediated by interactions with the SNARE motifs in the three proteins. The C-terminal site for CAPS binding on syntaxin-1 does not overlap the Munc18-1 binding site and both proteins can co-reside on membrane-integrated syntaxin-1. As expected for a C-terminal binding site on syntaxin-1, CAPS stimulates SNARE-dependent liposome fusion with N-terminal truncated syntaxin-1 but exhibits impaired activity with C-terminal syntaxin-1 mutants. Overall the results suggest that SNARE complex formation promoted by CAPS may be mediated by direct interactions of CAPS with each of the three SNARE proteins required for vesicle exocytosis.", "meta": {"pmid": 20826818}}

As simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin, promotes Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles, we investigated if simvastatin directly activates skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) ryanodine receptors. RyR1 and RyR2 single-channel behaviour was investigated after incorporation of sheep cardiac or mouse skeletal SR into planar phospholipid bilayers under voltage-clamp conditions. LC-MS was used to monitor the kinetics of interconversion of simvastatin between hydroxy-acid and lactone forms during these experiments. Cardiac and skeletal myocytes were permeabilised to examine simvastatin modulation of SR Ca2+ release. Hydroxy acid simvastatin (active at HMG-CoA reductase) significantly and reversibly increased RyR1 open probability (Po) and shifted the distribution of Ca2+ spark frequency towards higher values in skeletal fibres. In contrast, simvastatin reduced RyR2 Po and shifted the distribution of spark frequency towards lower values in ventricular cardiomyocytes. The lactone pro-drug form of simvastatin (inactive at HMG-CoA reductase) also activated RyR1, suggesting that the HMG-CoA inhibitor pharmacophore was not responsible for RyR1 activation. Simvastatin interacts with RyR1 to increase SR Ca2+ release and thus may contribute to its reported adverse effects on skeletal muscle. The ability of low concentrations of simvastatin to reduce RyR2 Po may also protect against Ca2+ -dependent arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.", "meta": {"pmid": 29278865}}

Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by partial or complete pubertal failure. HH may result from inadequate hypothalamic GnRH axis activation, or a failure of pituitary gonadotropin secretion/effects. In man, several genes that participate in olfactory and GnRH neuronal migration are thought to interact during the embryonic life. A growing number of mutations in different genes are responsible for congenital HH. Based on the presence or absence of olfaction dysfunction, HH is divided in two syndromes: HH with olfactory alterations [Kallmann syndrome (KS)] and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) with normal smell (normosmic IHH). KS is a heterogeneous disorder affecting 1 in 5000 males, with a three to fivefold of males over females. KS is associated with mutations in KAL1, FGFR1/FGF8, FGF17, IL17RD, PROK2/PROKR2, NELF, CHD7, HS6ST1, FLRT3, SPRY4, DUSP6, SEMA3A, NELF, and WDR11 genes that are related to defects in neuronal migration.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that an effector loop mutant of ras p21 was defective in interacting with the ras p21-interacting domain of RGL, suggesting that this domain binds to ras p21 through the effector loop of ras p21. Since ralGDS contained a region highly homologous with the ras p21-interacting domain of RGL, we examined whether ralGDS could interact with ras p21. In the yeast two-hybrid system, ralGDS failed to interact with an effector loop mutant of ras p21. In insect cells, ralGDS made a complex with v-ras p21 but not with a dominant negative mutant of ras p21. ralGDS interacted with the GTP-bound form of ras p21 but not with the GDP-bound form in vitro. ralGDS inhibited both the GTPase-activating activity of the neurofibromatosis gene product (NF1) for ras p21 and the interaction of Raf with ras p21 in vitro. These results demonstrate that ralGDS specifically interacts with the active form of ras p21 and that ralGDS can compete with NF1 and Raf for binding to the effector loop of ras p21.

{"text": "Treatment of chronic pain is complicated by the evidence that abuse of prescription opioids is rising; therefore, in many cases, chronic pain remains undertreated. Tramadol is an atypical central analgesic with a mixed mechanism of action offering many advantages over conventional opioids. We exploited the nonopioid action of tramadol, by bypassing the first-pass effect, as well as multiparticulate drug delivery. Our aim was to identify optimal formulation parameters for designing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), single and mixed dual cross-linked tramadol microspheres-loaded hydrogel with adequate bioadhesion and providing controlled drug release for buccal delivery. Microspheres characterization was done by scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Other investigations comprised the evaluation of yield, drug content, particle size, rheology, swelling, mucoadhesion, release, and permeation studies through biological membranes all together with testing the antinociceptive activity and its attenuation by the antagonist naloxone HCl. PVA-alginate microspheres (F3)-loaded carbopol hydrogel attained: the highest mucoadhesion time (1436.67\u2009min \u00b1 5.77) and mucin adsorption capacity, shear thinning thixotropic properties with adequate yield value and hysteresis area, best drug release (RE\u2009=\u200984.20\u2009\u00b1\u20092.07%) and permeation efficiency (PE\u2009=\u200965.30\u2009\u00b1\u20097.02%). Dissolution and permeation profiles were compared using similarity factor; F3-loaded carbogel had the lowest value. During in vivo study, the nonsignificant difference between the AUC of the groups receiving F3-loaded carbogel buccally with (group 5) and without (group 4) administration of naloxone, and between group 4 and the oral group, showed that the buccal route may arguably provide an alternative safer route of tramadol administration.", "meta": {"pmid": 21942308}}

Therefore, here we investigated the signaling pathways in these mice and discovered a central role of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), in mediating osteomyelitis. Using several mutant mouse strains, immunoblotting, and microcomputed tomography, we demonstrate that absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), receptor-interacting serine/ threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), and caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) are each dispensable for osteomyelitis induction in Pstpip2cmo mice, whereas genetic deletion of Syk completely abrogates the disease phenotype. We further show that SYK centrally mediates signaling upstream of caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation and principally up-regulates NF-\u03baB and IL-1\u03b2 signaling in Pstpip2cmo mice, thereby inducing cmo These results provide a rationale for directly targeting SYK and its downstream signaling components in CRMO.", "meta": {"pmid": 31719149}}

Under pentobarbital anesthesia, rats were fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus and a stainless steel guide cannula for drug administration was implanted into the lateral ventricle. In amygdaloid kindled seizures, electrodes were implanted into the right amygdala and electroencephalogram was recorded bipolarly; stimulation was applied bipolarly every day by a constant current stimulator and continued until a generalized convulsion was obtained. In the maximal electroshock (MES) seizure test, electroconvulsion was induced by stimulating animals through ear-clip electrodes, and the durations of tonic and clonic seizures were measured. Thioperamide, clobenpropit, iodophenpropit, VUF5514, VUF5515 and VUF4929 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of both seizure stage and afterdischarge (AD) duration of amygdaloid kindled seizures. The duration of tonic seizure induced by MES was also inhibited by H3 antagonists, but the duration of clonic seizures were unchanged. Among the H3 antagonists tested, clobenpropit and iodophenpropit were somewhat more potent than the other drugs on amygdaloid kindled seizures and MES seizures, respectively.

We hypothesized that molecular alterations may inform prognostication in advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC). We evaluated 124 aUC patients who underwent cfDNA analysis using a 73-gene sequencing panel (Guardant360). The association of molecular alterations and clinical factors with overall survival (OS) and failure-free-survival (FFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression. The median age was 72yr, and 65 patients (52.4%) received prior therapy with platinum, 21 (17.1%) with a taxane, and ten (8.1%) with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. At least one genomic alteration was detected in 112 patients (90.3%). The median number of alterations per sample was four (range 0-80). Commonly altered genes included TP53 (54.8%), PIK3CA (24.2%), ARID1A (22.6%), ERBB2 (19.4%), EGFR (16.1%), NF1 (13.7%), RB1 (12.9%), FGFR3 (11.3%), BRAF (10.5%), BRCA1 (10.5%), and RAF1 (8.9%).

{"text": "Fluvastatin, the first fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidaemia, to prevent subsequent coronary events in patients with established coronary heart disease, and to alter endothelial function and plaque stability in animal models. Fluvastatin is relatively hydrophilic, compared with the semisynthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and, therefore, it is extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, it is nearly completely extracted and metabolised in the liver to 2 hydroxylated metabolites and an N-desisopropyl metabolite, which are excreted in the bile. Approximately 95% of a dose is recovered in the faeces, with 60% of a dose recovered as the 3 metabolites. The 6-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl fluvastatin metabolites are exclusively generated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and do not accumulate in the blood. CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 form the 5-hydroxy fluvastatin metabolite. Because of its hydrophilic nature and extensive plasma protein binding, fluvastatin has a small volume of distribution with minimal concentrations in extrahepatic tissues. The pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin are not influenced by renal function, due to its extensive metabolism and biliary excretion; limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest a 30% reduction in oral clearance. Age and gender do not appear to affect the disposition of fluvastatin. CYP3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin, ketoconazole and itraconazole) have no effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, in contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are primarily metabolised by CYP3A and are subject to potential drug interactions with CYP3A inhibitors. Coadministration of fluvastatin with gastrointestinal agents such as cholestyramine, and gastric acid regulating agents (H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors), significantly alters fluvastatin disposition by decreasing and increasing bioavailability, respectively. The nonspecific CYP inducer rifampicin (rifampin) significantly increases fluvastatin oral clearance. In addition to being a CYP2C9 substrate, fluvastatin demonstrates inhibitory effects on this isoenzyme in vitro and in vivo. In human liver microsomes, fluvastatin significantly inhibits the hydroxylation of 2 CYP2C9 substrates, tolbutamide and diclofenac. The oral clearances of the CYP2C9 substrates diclofenac, tolbutamide, glibenclamide (glyburide) and losartan are reduced by 15 to 25% when coadministered with fluvastatin.

Moreover, Plk4 phosphorylates the Cep152 N-terminus, but the functional consequence is unknown. Here, we show that Plk4 phosphorylates Asl and mapped 13 phospho-residues in Asl-A. Nonphosphorylatable alanine (13A) and phosphomimetic (13PM) mutants did not alter Asl function, presumably because of the dominant role of the Asl C-terminus in Plk4 stabilization and centriolar targeting. To address how Asl-A phosphorylation specifically affects Plk4 regulation, we generated Asl-A fragment phospho-mutants and expressed them in cultured Drosophila cells. Asl-A-13A stimulated kinase activity by relieving Plk4 autoinhibition. In contrast, Asl-A-13PM inhibited Plk4 activity by a novel mechanism involving autophosphorylation of Plk4's kinase domain. Thus, Asl-A's phosphorylation state determines which of Asl-A's two opposing effects are exerted on Plk4. Initially, nonphosphorylated Asl binds Plk4 and stimulates its kinase activity, but after Asl is phosphorylated, a negative-feedback mechanism suppresses Plk4 activity. This dual regulatory effect by Asl-A may limit Plk4 to bursts of activity that modulate centriole duplication.", "meta": {"pmid": 30256714}}

Retrospective follow-up study of patients using cisapride. Data for this study were obtained from the pharmacy database of the Dutch PHARMO record linkage system (n = 834,000). From 1994 to 1998, the prevalence rate of the observed versus expected use of any potentially interacting drug decreased significantly over time (p < 0.01). However, the number of days-at-risk and number of coprescriptions of potentially interacting drugs among cisapride users increased on average by 13% and 9% per year, respectively. This increase was almost exclusively explained by a large increase in concomitant prescribing of clarithromycin, the most commonly used potentially interacting drug. Decreases in prevalence rates were observed for all individual potentially interacting drugs, except for concomitant use of fluconazole and miconazole. Over the last few years, healthcare professionals have refrained from dispensing potentially interacting drugs to patients who use cisapride, probably as a result of drug warnings implemented during this period. The limited absolute effects result from an increase of coprescription and concomitant use of clarithromycin and fluconazole among cisapride users. Because therapeutically equivalent alternatives were available for both drugs, such combinations were avoidable.

{"text": "The mortality rate of suicidal parathion poisoning is particularly high, the onset of fulminant cholinergic signs, and the patients frequently present to the emergency physician with life-threatening symptoms. Despite this uniformity, subsequent clinical course differs significantly among patients, mostly not as a result of different delays in treatment or insufficiency of primary care. Probably, the differences depend on the amount of poison absorbed and/or the disposition of the active poison, paraoxon. We followed the toxicokinetics of parathion and tried to quantify the actual poison load. To this end, we monitored parathion-intoxicated patients (patients requiring artificial ventilation) for plasma levels of parathion and paraoxon along with the activity of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase and its reactivatability. Plasma obidoxime concentrations were followed as well as the cumulative urinary para-nitrophenol conjugate excretion as a measure of total poison load. All patients received a standard obidoxime scheme of a 250 mg bolus dose intravenously, followed by continuous infusion with 750 mg per 24 hours as long as reactivation could be expected (usually 1 week). All other treatment was instituted as judged by the physician. It was recommended to use atropine at low doses to achieve dry mucous membranes, no bronchoconstriction and no bradycardia. Usually 1-2 mg/h were sufficient. Seven selected cases are presented exemplifying toxicokinetic peculiarities. All patients were severely intoxicated, while the amount of parathion absorbed varied widely (between 0.12 and 4.4 g; lethal dose 0.02-0.1 g) and was generally much lower than anticipated from the reports of relatives. It remains open whether the discrepancies between reports and findings were due to exaggeration or to effective decontamination (including spontaneous vomiting, gastric lavage and activated charcoal). Absorption of parathion from the gastrointestinal tract was sometimes retarded, up to 5 days, resulting in fluctuating plasma profiles. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss) of parathion was around 20 L/kg. Post-mortem analysis in one patient revealed a 66-fold higher parathion concentration in fat tissue compared with plasma, 16 days after ingestion. Biotransformation of parathion varied widely and was severely retarded in one patient receiving fluconazole during worsening of renal function, while phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) sedation (two cases) had apparently no effect. The proportion of plasma parathion to paraoxon varied from 0.3-30, pointing also to varying paraoxon elimination, as illustrated by one case with particularly low paraoxonase-1 activity. Obidoxime was effective at paraoxon concentrations below 0.5 microM, provided aging was not too advanced. This concentration correlated poorly with the paration concentration or the poison load. The data are discussed in light of the pertinent literature.", "meta": {"pmid": 15181664}}
{"text": "Cediranib is a potent inhibitor of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and VEGFR-3 tyrosine kinases. This study assessed the activity of cediranib against the VEGFR-1 tyrosine kinase and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-associated kinases c-Kit, PDGFR-\u03b1, and PDGFR-\u03b2. Cediranib inhibited VEGF-A-stimulated VEGFR-1 activation in AG1-G1-Flt1 cells (IC(50) = 1.2 nmol/L). VEGF-A induced greatest phosphorylation of VEGFR-1 at tyrosine residues Y1048 and Y1053; this was reversed by cediranib. Potency against VEGFR-1 was comparable with that previously observed versus VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Cediranib also showed significant activity against wild-type c-Kit in cellular phosphorylation assays (IC(50) = 1-3 nmol/L) and in a stem cell factor-induced proliferation assay (IC(50) = 13 nmol/L). Furthermore, phosphorylation of wild-type c-Kit in NCI-H526 tumor xenografts was reduced markedly following oral administration of cediranib (\u22651.5 mg/kg/d) to tumor-bearing nude mice. The activity of cediranib against PDGFR-\u03b2 and PDGFR-\u03b1 was studied in tumor cell lines, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and a fibroblast line using PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB ligands. Both receptor phosphorylation (IC(50) = 12-32 nmol/L) and PDGF-BB-stimulated cellular proliferation (IC(50) = 32 nmol/L in human VSMCs; 64 nmol/L in osteosarcoma cells) were inhibited. In vivo, ligand-induced PDGFR-\u03b2 phosphorylation in murine lung tissue was inhibited by 55% following treatment with cediranib at 6 mg/kg but not at 3 mg/kg or less. In contrast, in C6 rat glial tumor xenografts in mice, ligand-induced phosphorylation of both PDGFR-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2 was reduced by 46% to 61% with 0.75 mg/kg cediranib. Additional selectivity was showed versus Flt-3, CSF-1R, EGFR, FGFR1, and FGFR4. Collectively, these data indicate that cediranib is a potent pan-VEGFR kinase inhibitor with similar activity against c-Kit but is significantly less potent than PDGFR-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2.", "meta": {"pmid": 21441409}}
{"text": "One approach to resolving the complexities of chondrogenesis is to examine simplified systems in vitro. We analyzed cartilage differentiation by human adult stem cells from bone marrow stroma. Marrow stromal cells were cultured as micromass pellets for 21 days in serum-free medium containing transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta3, dexamethasone, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-6. Assays for pulse-labeled [3H]DNA and for total DNA indicated that there was little proliferation and a progressive loss of cells in the pellets. There were continuous increases in mRNAs for cartilage matrix (proteoglycans and COL2, -9, -10, and -11), receptors [fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor (PTHrP-R)], and transcription factors (SOX5, -6, and -9) as demonstrated by histochemical and microarray assays. Reverse transcription-PCR assays for 11 mRNAs confirmed the microarray data. SOX4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) increased at day 1 and decreased thereafter, suggesting roles early in chondrogenesis. Also, forkhead, CD10, and MMP13 increased up to day 7 and decreased thereafter, suggesting roles in an intermediate stage of chondrogenesis. In addition, two collagens (COL3A1 and COL16A1), a signaling molecule (WNT11), a homeobox homolog (BAPX1), a receptor (IL-1R1), an IGFs modulator (IGFBP5), and a mettaloproteinase (MMP16) increased progressively up to about day 14, suggesting roles later in chondrogenesis.

Follow-up of a large cohort with subsequent detailed review of individuals for whom therapy had been initiated following diagnosis of SCHo. Data on practice policies, and rationale behind treatment were collected via GP questionnaire. Forty-two individuals were treated following identification of SCHo. Factors regarded as supporting instigation of therapy recorded by practitioners included symptoms, a positive antithyroid antibody test and history of radioiodine therapy. In all, 55% were registered at 3/19 practices suggesting significant between practice variation. Reasons for testing included chronic disease check-up (n = 14), presenting 'thyroid symptoms' (n = 5) and presenting other symptoms (n = 9). Reasons for therapy initiation were only recorded in 26 cases and included presence of symptoms, persistently high or increasing serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration and patient request. Only 2/15 GPs reported having practice guidelines on management. Results suggest that GPs are uncertain how to interpret symptoms and TFT results in older individuals.

{"text": "Catecholamines govern stress blood pressure responses. Catecholaminergic responses may be partially genetic and contribute to the complex heritability of hypertension. To evaluate catecholaminergic responses without systemic counterregulation, we infused graded concentrations of tyramine, an indirect presynaptic norepinephrine releaser, into dorsal hand veins of 49 normotensive men and women of 5 ethnicities. Vascular responses were coupled to common (minor allele frequency >10%) single-nucleotide polymorphisms at adrenergic target loci within presynaptic pathways. Significance was set at P<0.003 after Bonferroni correction. Generalized analysis of molecular variance (GAMOVA) was performed to determine whether genetic admixture contributed to results. Venoconstriction progressed to 47% with increasing concentrations of tyramine (0.129 to 25.8 mmol/L; P<0.001). Family history of hypertension (P<0.001) and female sex (P=0.02) predicted blunted tyramine responses. Two genetic loci significantly predicted vascular response: chromogranin B, which encodes a protein that catalyzes catecholamine vesicle formation (CHGB, exon 4, Glu348Glu; P=0.002), and cytochrome b-561 (CYB561, intron 1, C719G; P<0.001), an electron shuttle for catecholamine synthesis. Stepwise regression suggested important effects for the CHGB locus, with polymorphisms for the vacuolar-ATPase beta-subunit (ATP6V1B1, exon 1, Ile30Thr) and flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3, exon 3, Lys158Glu, P=0.002). GAMOVA did not show a significant relationship between overall genetic profile and hand-vein constriction (P=0.29), which indicates that population stratification did not contribute to this phenotype. Locally infused tyramine produced dose-dependent pressor responses, predicted by family history of hypertension, sex, and genetic variants at loci, particularly CHGB, that encode the biosynthesis, storage, and metabolism of catecholamines. Such variants may influence the complex heritability of adrenergic responses and perhaps hypertension.", "meta": {"pmid": 18180394}}
{"text": "Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) leads to the development of mixed anxiety/depression-like state in male mice similar to those in humans. It has been shown that, under CSDS, the adult brain undergoes changes in the functioning neurotransmitter systems in different brain regions. In this experiment we are focused on the analysis of expression of genes encoding proteins related with the metabolism and receptors of serotonin, catecholamines, GABA and glutamate in the ventral teg- mental area which is important for regulation of motivations, emotions and is involved into mech- anisms of affective disorders. Mixed anxiety/depression-like state was generated in male mice by exposure to CSDS during 20 days. The collected samples of the ventral tegmental area were se-- quenced at JSC Genoanalytica,(http://genoanalytica.ru/, Moscow, Russia).'We found that genes, related with serotonin (Tph2, Maob, SIc6a4, Htr4, Htr1a) were upregulated but expression of Htr3a gene was downregulated in the ventral tegmental area of depressive mice in comparison with the control. Besides, upregulation of dopaminergic Th, Ddc, Slc6a3, Sic18a2, Drd2, and Maob genes was found while noradrenergic Dbh, Slc6a2, Adra2c, and Adra2a genes were downregulated.

Development of mixed anxiety/depression-like state under CSDS in male mice is accompanied by increased expression of genes coding the proteins participating in the metabolism and receptions of serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. Expression of genes coding the adrenergic reception is decreased.

{"text": "The cytoplasmic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) targeting complex is required for the transfer of an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster to cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, but how it engages with client proteins is unknown. Here, we show that the complex members MIP18 and CIAO1 associate with the C terminus of MMS19. By doing so, they form a docking site for Fe-S proteins that is disrupted in the absence of either MMS19 or MIP18. The Fe-S helicase XPD seems to be the only exception, since it can interact with MMS19 independently of MIP18 and CIAO1. We\u00a0further show that the direct interaction between MMS19 and MIP18 is required to protect MIP18 from proteasomal degradation. Taken together, these data suggest a remarkably regulated interaction between the CIA targeting complex and client proteins and raise the possibility that Fe-S cluster transfer is controlled, at least in part, by the stability of the CIA targeting complex itself.", "meta": {"pmid": 28178521}}
{"text": "Mutations in RBM20 (RNA-binding motif protein 20) cause a clinically aggressive form of dilated cardiomyopathy, with an increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. RBM20 is a splicing factor that targets multiple pivotal cardiac genes, such as Titin (TTN) and CAMK2D (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II delta). Aberrant TTN splicing is thought to be the main determinant of RBM20-induced dilated cardiomyopathy, but is not likely to explain the increased risk of arrhythmias. Here, we investigated the extent to which RBM20 mutation carriers have an increased risk of arrhythmias and explore the underlying molecular mechanism. We compared clinical characteristics of RBM20 and TTN mutation carriers and used our previously generated Rbm20 knockout (KO) mice to investigate downstream effects of Rbm20-dependent splicing. Cellular electrophysiology and Ca2+ measurements were performed on isolated cardiomyocytes from Rbm20 KO mice to determine the intracellular consequences of reduced Rbm20 levels. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent in human RBM20 mutation carriers than in TTN mutation carriers (44% versus 5%, respectively, P=0.006). Splicing events that affected Ca2+- and ion-handling genes were enriched in Rbm20 KO mice, most notably in the genes CamkII\u03b4 and RyR2. Aberrant splicing of CamkII\u03b4 in Rbm20 KO mice resulted in a remarkable shift of CamkII\u03b4 toward the \u03b4-A isoform that is known to activate the L-type Ca2+ current ( ICa,L). In line with this, we found an increased ICa,L, intracellular Ca2+ overload and increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content in Rbm20 KO myocytes. In addition, not only complete loss of Rbm20, but also heterozygous loss of Rbm20 increased spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ releases, which could be attenuated by treatment with the ICa,L antagonist verapamil. We show that loss of Rbm20 disturbs Ca2+ handling and leads to more proarrhythmic Ca2+ releases from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Patients that carry a pathogenic RBM20 mutation have more ventricular arrhythmias despite a similar left ventricular function, in comparison with patients with a TTN mutation. Our experimental data suggest that RBM20 mutation carriers may benefit from treatment with an ICa,L blocker to reduce their arrhythmia burden.", "meta": {"pmid": 29650543}}

The presence of a 2-nt deletion of DEFB126, and its protein expression in spermatozoa, were investigated by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing and immunocytochemistry, respectively. MAR technique outcome according to clinical pregnancy rates was assessed in 277 Iranian males with unexplained infertility, including 139 patients who underwent intrauterine insemination (IUI) and 103 patients who underwent IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), as well as 35 infertile males who declined to use any MAR treatment. As the control group, 100 fertile males with a normal spermiogram were enrolled. The 2-nt deletion of DEFB126 was significantly higher in infertile patients than controls (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The presence of this deletion resulted in significantly lower clinical pregnancy rates following IUI (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05); however, there were no differences in IVF/ICSI outcomes according to genotype. The protein expression in del/del males was also remarkably lower than that of the other genotypes. This sequence variation of DEFB126 may impair male reproductive function and can be related to male infertility.

{"text": "Many aspects of and factors required for DNA replication are conserved across all three domains of life, but there are some significant differences surrounding lagging-strand synthesis. In Archaea, a 5'-to-3' exonuclease, related to both bacterial RecJ and eukaryotic Cdc45, that associates with the replisome specifically through interactions with GINS was identified and designated GAN (for GINS-associated nuclease). Despite the presence of a well-characterized flap endonuclease (Fen1), it was hypothesized that GAN might participate in primer removal during Okazaki fragment maturation, and as a Cdc45 homologue, GAN might also be a structural component of an archaeal CMG (Cdc45, MCM, and GINS) replication complex. We demonstrate here that, individually, either Fen1 or GAN can be deleted, with no discernible effects on viability and growth. However, deletion of both Fen1 and GAN was not possible, consistent with both enzymes catalyzing the same step in primer removal from Okazaki fragments in vivo RNase HII has also been proposed to participate in primer processing during Okazaki fragment maturation. Strains with both Fen1 and RNase HII deleted grew well. GAN activity is therefore sufficient for viability in the absence of both RNase HII and Fen1, but it was not possible to construct a strain with both RNase HII and GAN deleted. Fen1 alone is therefore insufficient for viability in the absence of both RNase HII and GAN. The ability to delete GAN demonstrates that GAN is not required for the activation or stability of the archaeal MCM replicative helicase.IMPORTANCE The mechanisms used to remove primer sequences from Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA replication differ in the biological domains. Bacteria use the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, whereas eukaryotes and archaea encode a flap endonuclease (Fen1) that cleaves displaced primer sequences. RNase HII and the GINS-associated exonuclease GAN have also been hypothesized to assist in primer removal in Archaea Here we demonstrate that in Thermococcus kodakarensis, either Fen1 or GAN activity is sufficient for viability.

Co-prescription of the selected CYP3A4 inhibitors diltiazem, verapamil, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole with either simvastatin or atorvastatin was detected with the aid of a simple computer programme. In instances where the pharmacist alerted the prescribing physician about the co-prescription, information on possible strategies to minimize the risk associated with the interaction was also provided. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated to describe the associations between prescription variables and frequencies of physician information and prescription change, respectively. In total, 245 co-prescriptions of CYP3A4 inhibitors with simvastatin (134 events) or atorvastatin (111) were detected. Diltiazem (86 events), verapamil (72), erythromycin (48) and clarithromycin (29) were the most commonly co-prescribed CYP3A4 inhibitors. Physicians were informed in 168 out of 245 cases (68.6%).

Here we present the remarkable morphology changes of Bi2Te3 surfaces, which have been freshly cleaved in air, upon subsequent systematic annealing in ultrahigh vacuum and the resulting effects on the local and area-averaging electronic properties of the surface states, which are investigated by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings demonstrate that the annealing induces the formation of a Bi bilayer atop the Bi2Te3 surface. The adlayer results in n-type doping, and the atomic defects act as scattering centers of the TSS electrons. We also investigated the annealing-induced Bi bilayer surface on Bi2Te3 via voltage-dependent quasi-particle-interference (QPI) mapping of the surface local density of states and via comparison with the calculated constant-energy contours and QPI patterns. We observed closed hexagonal patterns in the Fourier transform of real-space QPI maps with secondary outer spikes. DFT calculations attribute these complex QPI patterns to the appearance of a \"second\" cone due to the surface charge transfer between the Bi bilayer and the Bi2Te3.

This assessment is timely, inasmuch as several treatment trials have been published within the past 2 yr, necessitating an appraisal of the outcome of treatments. Literature review based on Medline Search using key words: gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, enteral nutrition, feeding jejunostomy, prokinetics, gastric atony, gastrectomy, Roux-Y gastrectomy. Restoration of nutrition can be achieved orally, enterally, or parenterally, depending on the severity of the clinical syndrome. Combinations of antiemetics and prokinetics are useful for symptomatic and objective benefits. Intravenous erythromycin is chiefly beneficial in the acute presentation. The weight of current evidence favors cisapride as the prokinetic of choice in the medium and long term. Surgical approaches are restricted to providing a means for decompression, access to the small bowel for nutrition, and resection for localized disease or completion of gastrectomies for atony after gastric surgery. More rational choices of access for nutritional supplementation, selection of prokinetic agents, and indications for surgical treatment can be made on the basis of clinical experience and published studies; however, several unanswered questions remain and call for further outcome-based studies in patients with gastroparesis and CID.", "meta": {"pmid": 7942664}}
{"text": "Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses the disease entities, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). An aetiologic agent has not yet been defined and the diagnosis is based, therefore, on the sum of clinical, paraclinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histopathologic features. In recent years pathogenetic studies have focused on immune mechanisms, transmissible infectious agents, the potential role of the normal intestinal flora, dietary factors, enzymatic alterations and genetic features, in addition to vascular, neuromotor, allergic and psychologic factors. The prevalence of IBD is increased in first-degree relatives of patients and there is a high rate of disease concordance among monozygotic twins. Thus abnormal genes may encode for one or several immunoregulatory factors, while bacterial wall products seem to activate colonic inflammatory cells in a non-specific way, leading to increased production of cytokines, complement-derived peptides, eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, biogenic amines, kinins, chemotactic oligopeptides, and neuropeptides. The named soluble inflammatory mediators, in addition to free oxygen radicals, are considered responsible for the secondary amplification of the inflammatory process. The corner stones in medical therapy of IBD are still corticosteroids and sulphasalazine (SAZ). The new oral salicylates, which are analogues of SAZ or \"slow release\" preparations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine), have provided a therapeutic progress, because they are tolerated better than SAZ. Immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, reduce the requirement for corticosteroids and are effective in refractory CD, but the effect is delayed up to several months. The therapeutic action of cyclosporine A is not sustained, but often associated with side effects. Metronidazole has a beneficial effect on perineal disease.", "meta": {"pmid": 1413128}}

It is developed for oral or intravenous administration for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). To establish the non-inferiority of levonadifloxacin compared with linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and to compare the safety of the two antimicrobials. This was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, open-label, active- comparator study with 500 subjects. Oral levonadifloxacin 1000 mg was compared with oral linezolid 600 mg whereas IV levonadifloxacin 800mg was compared with IV linezolid 600 mg, each treatment was administered twice daily for 7-10 days. Non-inferiority was evaluated by comparing oral levonadifloxacin to oral linezolid and IV levonadifloxacin to IV linezolid for overall clinical response at TOC (Test of Cure) Visit. The clinical cure rates observed at the TOC in the mITT (modified Intent to treat) populations for levonadifloxacin was numerically higher compared to linezolid in the IV sub-group [(91.0% verses 87.8%); treatment difference of 3.2% (95%CI, -4.5 to 10.9)] and in the oral sub-group (95.2% versus 93.6%); treatment difference of 1.6 % [95%CI, -4.2 to 7.3]). As the lowerbound of the 95% CI around the treatment difference was greater than -15% for both subgroups, the primary objective of the study was met. Therefore, both IV levonadifloxacin and oral levonadifloxacin were non-inferior to IV linezolid and oral linezolid, respectively. The majority of subjects in the micro-ITT population had a baseline infection caused by S. aureus with approximately 30% of subjects having MRSA. Levonadifloxacin (IV and oral) had a higher clinical cure rate at TOC for MRSA patients compared with linezolid (IV and oral), (95.0% vs. 89.3% respectively). Levonadifloxacin showed evidence of favourable clinical and microbiological efficacy in subjects with concurrent bacteraemia as well as in subjects with diabetes including diabetic foot infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that bioavailability of oral levonadifloxacin was 90% and similar pharmacokinetic profile of levonadifloxacin by both routes provide an option for IV to oral switch for the treatment of subjects. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between treatment groups and between IV (20.8% vs. 22.4%, for levonadifloxacin and linezolid, respectively) and oral therapy (16.0% vs. 13.5%, respectively), There were no SAEs or deaths related to study drug and the majority of the AEs observed were mild in nature. Overall, the administration of both IV and oral levonadifloxacin was well-tolerated in subjects with ABSSSI. The results demonstrate that IV and oral levonadifloxacin therapy has excellent clinical activity against MRSA and offers advantage compared to other quinolones which generally lack MRSA coverage. Levonadifloxacin is safe and well tolerated in the treatment of ABSSSI caused by Gram -positive pathogens including MRSA as well as non-inferior to IV and oral linezolid, respectively. Similar pharmacokinetic profile of IV and oral levonadifloxacin provides an option for IV to oral switch for the treatment of subjects.

This suggests that blocking specific IFN-\u03b3-related pathways that may only partially inhibit IFN-\u03b3 production or function will also suppress autoimmunity. To test this hypothesis, mice deficient in genes regulating IFN-\u03b3 expression (Casp1, Nlrp3, Il12a, Il12b, Stat4) or function (Ifngr1, Irf1) were examined for mHgIA susceptibility. Absence of either Ifngr1 or Irf1 resulted in a striking reduction of disease, while deficiency of genes promoting IFN-\u03b3 expression had modest to no effect. Furthermore, both Irf1- and Ifng-deficiency only modestly reduced the expansion of CD44(hi) and CD44(hi)CD55(lo) CD4(+) T cells, indicating that they are not absolutely required for T cell activation. Thus, there is substantial redundancy in genes that regulate IFN-\u03b3 expression in contrast to those that mediate later signaling events.

{"text": "Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are a powerful independent cardiovascular risk factor, bearing an inverse relationship with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (with risk rising sharply when levels are <1.04 mmol/L). Apart from its protective role in atherosclerosis, HDL-C increases fibrinolysis, is an antioxidant to low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreases platelet aggregability. Up to a third of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have 'desirable' plasma levels of total cholesterol but low HDL-C levels. Benefits of treating low plasma HDL-C levels were clearly demonstrated in the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) where gemfibrozil reduced nonfatal infarcts and coronary deaths by 22%. This was achieved by a 6% increase in plasma HDL-C levels, and a 24.5% decrease in plasma levels of triglycerides, without any significant decrease in LDL-C levels. Multivariate analyses revealed the rise in plasma HDL-C levels after treatment, but not decreases in plasma levels of triglycerides or LDL-C, predicted coronary artery disease events. The typical patient under consideration in this article is one with plasma levels of HDL-C <1 mmol/L, LDL-C <3.37 mmol/L [either receiving therapeutic lifestyle changes or or LDL-C-lowering therapy comprising a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor or bile acid sequestrant] and fasting triglycerides <2.26 mmol/L. We propose this dyslipidemia be classified as Type VI phenotype following the Frederickson and Lees classification. High-risk patients (with >/=2 risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or 10-year cardiovascular risk >20%), patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome should receive pharmacotherapy. Plasma HDL-C levels >1.16 mmol/L may be considered optimal and between 1 and 1.16 mmol/L as desirable. Fibric acid derivatives, nicotinic acid, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogens, and ethanol (not recommended as therapy) increase plasma HDL-C levels. Nicotinic acid is the most potent agent and recent reports indicate that, in contrast to gemfibrozil, it selectively increases antiatherogenic HDL subfraction, lipoprotein (Lp) AI (without apolipoprotein AII), in patients with low plasma HDL-C levels. An extended-release formulation, administered once daily, has improved the tolerability of nicotinic acid. Recent evidence also indicates that nicotinic acid may effectively correct dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes mellitus without significantly compromising glycemic control. Fibric acid derivatives and estrogen raise plasma HDL-C levels by different mechanisms of action, and these agents may be used with nicotinic acid.

{"text": "Recognition of the role of active metabolites in mediating therapeutic and/or adverse effects of many antidepressants is an important part of understanding the mechanisms of action of these medications. While virtually all antidepressants except lithium undergo extensive hepatic metabolism, the profile of activity of the resulting breakdown products varies considerably.The metabolites of some antidepressants share the primary biochemical actions of their parent compounds and appear to contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of those medications. Examples of this are the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) nor-triptyline, the selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and the serotonin-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Less commonly, the activity of the primary metabolite may differ from that of the parent drug. An example is clomipramine. This drug is a potent serotonin reuptake blocking TCA, but its demethyl-metabolites are noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. On the other hand, a number of effective anti-depressants, including most of the SSRIs other than fluoxetine, lack active metabolites.On the negative side, antidepressant metabolites may add to the adverse effect burden presented by their drugs of origin. At sufficiently high doses, the amphetamines resulting from the metabolism of some monoamine oxidase inhibitors, e.g. selegiline (deprenyl), may directly produce toxicity from the pharmacodynamic interaction with the parent antidepressant. While hydroxy-nortriptyline produces lesser anticholinergic effects than its parent compound, this metabolite may block the therapeutic action of nortriptyline when present in high concentrations. Excessive plasma concentrations of the major metabolite of amfebutamone (bupropion) have been associated with nonresponse and clinical worsening in some patients.Amfebutamone also illustrates the importance of pharmacokinetic factors in determining the magnitude of the influence of metabolites on antidepressant action. Active metabolites that have long elimination half-lives may predominate over the parent compound in plasma and CSF, exerting considerable clinical impact. With several of the newer drugs, notably amfebutamone, venlafaxine and nefazodone, the presence of active metabolites with half-lives approaching 1 day suggests that once-daily administration may be sufficient.The formation of most antidepressant metabolites is under strong genetic control and the metabolites themselves often exert effects on hepatic enzyme systems. This can lead to the possibility of drug-drug interactions. A key example is norfluoxetine, which is associated with potent inhibition of the cytochrome P450 isozyme 2D6 (and, consequently, reduced metabolism of drugs such as TCAs). This effect lasts for weeks even after fluoxetine discontinuation, due to the fact that norfluoxetine has a half-life of up to 2 weeks.The clearance of most antidepressant metabolites is ultimately dependent on elimination by the kidneys. Therefore, these substances tend to accumulate in states of reduced renal function, including normal aging. The relative increase in TCA hydroxy-metabolite concentrations in the elderly may contribute to the cardiovascular and other toxicities of these antidepressants in this vulnerable patient population.Attention to the existence and implications of active metabolites from the earliest stages of antidepressant drug development may help optimise the benefit: risk ratio of this valuable class of psychotropic medications.

Recently, three G protein-coupled receptors (LPS1/GPR34, LPS2/P2Y10 and LPS3/GPR174) were found to react specifically with LysoPS, raising the possibility that LysoPS serves as a lipid mediator that exerts its role through these receptors. Previously, we chemically synthesized a number of LysoPS analogues and evaluated them as agonists for mast-cell degranulation. Here, we used a transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF\u03b1) shedding assay to see if these LysoPS analogues activated the three LysoPS receptors. Modification of the serine moiety significantly reduced the ability of the analogues to activate the three LysoPS receptors, whereas modification of other parts resulted in loss of activity in receptor-specific manner. We found that introduction of methyl group to serine moiety (1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidylallothreonine) and removal of sn-2 hydroxyl group (1-oleoyl-2-deoxy-LysoPS) resulted in reduction of reactivity with LPS1 and LPS3, respectively. Accordingly, we synthesized a LysoPS analogue with the two modifications (1-oleoyl-2-deoxy-lysophosphatidylallothreonine) and found it to be an LPS2-selective agonist.

The CBD1 and CBD2 domains form a regulatory tandem (CBD12), where Ca2+ binding to CBD1 activates and Ca2+ binding to CBD2 (bearing the splicing segment) alleviates the Na+-induced inactivation. Here, the NCX2-CBD12, NCX3-CBD12-B, and NCX3-CBD12-AC proteins were analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS) to resolve regulatory variances in the NCX2 and NCX3 variants. SAXS revealed the unified model, according to which the Ca2+ binding to CBD12 shifts a dynamic equilibrium without generating new conformational states, and where more rigid conformational states become more populated without any global conformational changes. HDX-MS revealed the differential effects of the B and AC exons on the folding stability of apo CBD1 in NCX3-CBD12, where the dynamic differences become less noticeable in the Ca2+-bound state. Therefore, the apo forms predefine incremental changes in backbone dynamics upon Ca2+ binding. These observations may account for slower inactivation (caused by slower dissociation of occluded Ca2+ from CBD12) in the skeletal vs the brain-expressed NCX2 and NCX3 variants.

{"text": "Gq-coupled plasma membrane receptors activate phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyzes membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). This leads to calcium release, protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and sometimes PIP2 depletion. To understand mechanisms governing these diverging signals and to determine which of these signals is responsible for the inhibition of KCNQ2/3 (KV7.2/7.3) potassium channels, we monitored levels of PIP2, IP3, and calcium in single living cells. DAG and PKC are monitored in our companion paper (Falkenburger et al. 2013. J. Gen. Physiol. http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201210887). The results extend our previous kinetic model of Gq-coupled receptor signaling to IP3 and calcium. We find that activation of low-abundance endogenous P2Y2 receptors by a saturating concentration of uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP; 100 \u00b5M) leads to calcium release but not to PIP2 depletion. Activation of overexpressed M1 muscarinic receptors by 10 \u00b5M Oxo-M leads to a similar calcium release but also depletes PIP2. KCNQ2/3 channels are inhibited by Oxo-M (by 85%), but not by UTP (<1%). These differences can be attributed purely to differences in receptor abundance. Full amplitude calcium responses can be elicited even after PIP2 was partially depleted by overexpressed inducible phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatases, suggesting that very low amounts of IP3 suffice to elicit a full calcium release. Hence, weak PLC activation can elicit robust calcium signals without net PIP2 depletion or KCNQ2/3 channel inhibition.", "meta": {"pmid": 23630337}}

The form of hypoaldosteronism which occurs in the adult is characterized by the following additional features: the aldosterone deficiency is due in the majority of cases to a decrease in enzymatically active plasma renin (\"hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism\"), while various endogenous mechanisms as well as certain drugs (prostaglandin inhibitors, beta-blockers) may contribute. Other disturbances of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g. during treatment with converting-enzyme inhibitors) may rarely be responsible. Abnormalities in adrenal cortical synthesis may sometimes coexist, but proof that adrenal enzymatic defects play a primary pathogenic role in selective hyperaldosteronism in the adult is lacking. Such patients are frequently older (greater than 50 years), and often have diabetes mellitus and/or nephropathy (diabetic, interstitial, or hydronephrosis).

Cdh2 is the most abundantly expressed type I cadherin throughout development, while Cdh1, Cdh3, and Cdh4 are expressed at low levels. Type II cadherins show a dynamic pattern of expression that varies between neuroanatomical structures and developmental ages. Atypical Cdh13 expression pattern correlates with Cdh2 in abundancy and localization. Analyses of cadherin-mediated relative adhesion estimated from their expression level and binding affinity show substantial differences in adhesive properties between regions of the neural tube associated with the segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis. Differences in relative adhesion were also observed between brain nuclei in the developing subpallium (basal ganglia), suggesting that differential cell adhesion contributes to the segregation of neuronal pools. In the adult cerebral cortex, type II cadherins Cdh6, Cdh8, Cdh10, and Cdh12 are abundant in intermediate layers, while Cdh11 shows a gradated expression from the deeper layer 6 to the superficial layer 1, and Cdh9, Cdh18, and Cdh24 are more abundant in the deeper layers. Person's correlation analyses of cadherins mRNA expression patterns between areas and layers of the cerebral cortex and the nuclei of the subpallium show significant correlations between certain cortical areas and the basal ganglia. The study shows that differential cadherin expression and cadherin-mediated adhesion are associated with a wide range of morphogenetic events in the developing central nervous system including the organization of neurons into layers, the segregation of neurons into nuclei, and the formation of neuronal circuits.", "meta": {"pmid": 33833667}}

{"text": "Excessive benzodiazepine use is a public health concern from clinical and economical perspectives. Although more benzodiazepines are prescribed in Japan than in any other country, no hospital-based report has documented this phenomenon. Therefore, this study compared the prescription frequency of benzodiazepines with that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and other antidepressants in a single Japanese hospital over 1 year. The annual prescription of benzodiazepines was assessed with that of antidepressants using an electronic database of medical records for outpatients at a Japanese tertiary care hospital affiliated with a private university with approximately 600,000 outpatient visits annually. Groups of departments were analyzed separately (i.e. internal medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, and others). The ratio of the number of prescriptions of anxiolytic benzodiazepines to that of SSRI and SNRI was calculated among the department groups and used as one of indicators comparing the prescriptions of benzodiazepines with those of antidepressants. Of 644,444 hospital prescriptions, 6.1% were for anxiolytic benzodiazepines, and 5.8% were for hypnotic benzodiazepines. Regarding antidepressants, 1.6% of prescriptions were for SSRIs/SNRIs, 0.8% were for tricyclic antidepressants, and 1.5% were for other antidepressants. Of the benzodiazepine prescriptions, 26.8% were written by the internal medicine group. The ratio of the number of prescriptions for anxiolytic benzodiazepines to that for SSRI and SNRI was highest in the department of internal medicine (ratio = 13.0), followed by surgery (7.6), neurology (4.8), and psychiatry (2.5). With the department of psychiatry as the reference, the tendency to prescribe an anxiolytic benzodiazepine rather than an SSRI or SNRI was statistically significant in the remaining four department groups, after controlling for the effects of patient age and sex in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Benzodiazepine prescriptions in the Japanese hospital were far more common than prescriptions for antidepressants such as SSRIs and SNRIs, especially in internal medicine. Multi-institutional studies are needed to address this issue in Japanese hospitals, as well as in hospitals in other countries.", "meta": {"pmid": 17256448}}

Clinical records and findings on light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of liver biopsy materials were reviewed. In seven patients from seven unrelated families, biallelic PPVs (10 in total) were found in USP53, recently associated with intrahepatic cholestasis. Seven variants were classified as pathogenic: one canonical splicing, c.569\u00a0+\u00a02T\u00a0>\u00a0C, and six nonsense or frameshifting: c.169C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.Arg57Ter), c.581delA (p.Arg195GlufsTer38), c.831_832insAG (p.Val279GlufsTer16), c.1012C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.Arg338Ter), c.1426C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.Arg476Ter) and c.1558C\u00a0>\u00a0T (p.Arg520Ter).

Our previous results demonstrated that the impaired steroidogenesis in the ovary of neonatally DES-treated mice was caused by altered gonadotropins levels, and resulted in the hypertrophy of ovarian interstitial cells. We speculated that lipid droplets in the ovary mainly consisted of cholesterol. This study was aimed to examine the effects of neonatal DES on cholesterol homeostasis in the ovary. The serum and ovarian total cholesterol concentrations in 3-month-old neonatally DES-treated mice were significantly higher than those in the neonatally oil-treated mice, but triglyceride concentrations were not altered. In the ovary of neonatally DES-treated mice, expression of Hmgcr, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, was reduced but expression of Ldlr and Scarb1, involved in cholesterol uptake, was not changed. These results suggest that cholesterol uptake is not altered in the ovary of 3-month-old neonatally DES-treated mice. However, the expression of Acat1, the microsomal acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase which is involved in cholesterol esterification and storing was increased compared with that in the ovary of neonatally oil-treated mice. Since ovarian steroidogenesis in neonatally DES-treated mice was impaired, synthesized and/or obtained cholesterol from the blood may not be used sufficiently. Thus, in the ovary of neonatally DES-treated mice, cholesterol is esterified by ACAT1 and stored in the interstitial cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 23426703}}

{"text": "Eicosanoids are believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of several models of glomerular disease. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduces proteinuria in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or other glomerular diseases. We have shown that sera of some patients with FSGS significantly increase glomerular albumin permeability (Palb) in an in vitro assay. To determine the role of eicosanoids in the increased Palb caused by the FSGS factor, glomeruli were isolated from normal rats, preincubated with indomethacin, then incubated with FSGS serum or normal serum and Palb was calculated. To study the direct effect of individual eicosanoids on Palb, glomeruli were incubated with prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha or a thromboxane A2 mimetic, and Palb was calculated. In the final set of experiments, normal glomeruli were preincubated with the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate, incubated with FSGS serum, and Palb was calculated. Preincubation of isolated glomeruli with either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor furegrelate protected glomeruli from the increase in Palb caused by FSGS serum. Each of the three principal glomerular eicosanoids significantly increased Palb of isolated glomeruli. These studies implicate a product of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism as mediating the increased Palb caused by FSGS serum in our in vitro assay and possibly the proteinuria seen in patients with FSGS.", "meta": {"pmid": 11849393}}

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 12 individuals (7 individuals from 3 pSS pedigrees and 5 sporadic cases) for whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. SNPs and CNVs were identified, followed by functional annotation of genes with SNPs and CNVs. Gene expression profile (involving 64 normal controls and 166 cases) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) dataset for differentially expression analysis. Sanger sequencing and in vitro validation was used to validate the identified SNPs and differentially expressed genes, respectively. A total of 5 SNPs were identified in both pedigrees and sporadic cases, such as FES, PPM1J, and TRAPPC9. A total of 3402 and 19 CNVs were identified in pedigrees and sporadic cases, respectively. Fifty-one differentially expressed genes were associated with immunity, such as BATF3, LAP3, BATF2, PARP9, and IL15RA. AMPK signaling pathway and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were the most significantly enriched signaling pathways of identified SNPs. Identified CNVs were associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, mineral absorption, and HTLV-I infection.

{"text": "Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in patients with glioma. The clotting factor von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a highly adhesive procoagulant molecule that mediates platelet adhesion to endothelial and subendothelial surfaces. In the current analysis, we examined The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to assess the VWF gene in patients with lower grade gliomas. For newly diagnosed gliomas, we evaluated the association between VWF and overall survival in the Genomic Data Commons TCGA Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) dataset in TCGA. Simple statistics were calculated to identify patterns of mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence of VWF mutations. For each pair of query genes an odds ratio was calculated that indicates the likelihood that the mutations in the two genes are mutually exclusive or co-occurrent across the selected cases. To determine whether the identified relationship was significant for a gene pair, Fisher's exact test was performed. Lower grade gliomas with less VWF gene expression had significantly better survival than those with more VWF gene expression (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 0.92, p=0.015 log rank test). When we analyzed the data with Cox regression, VWF expression had a significant effect on survival (p=0.02) that was unrelated to the effect of IDH1 expression (p=0.062), TP53 expression (p=0.135), independent of ATRX expression (p=0.021) and histology (astrocytoma versus oligoastrocytoma and oligodendroglioma, p=0.002). VWF mutations significantly co-occur with mutations in TP53 and ATRX (p<0.001). The deleterious prognostic effect of VWF expression and its co-occurrent mutations with TP53 and ATRX in lower grade gliomas are not surprising, given VWF's role in other cancers. Therefore, VWF gene expression may be a clinically important risk marker in lower grade glioma.", "meta": {"pmid": 31062529}}

Trigonella foenum graecum (Fenugreek) is traditionally applied to treat disorders such as diabetes, high cholesterol, wounds, inflammation, and gastrointestinal ailments. Fenugreek is also reported to have anticancer properties due to its active beneficial chemical constituents. The mechanism of action of several anticancer drugs is based on their ability to induce apoptosis. The objective of the study was to characterize the downstream apoptotic genes targeted by FCE in MCF-7 human immortalized breast cells. FCE effectively killed MCF-7 cells through induction of apoptosis,confirmed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and RT-PCR assays. When cells were exposed to 50 \u03bcg/mL FCE for 24 hours, 23.2% apoptotic cells resulted, while a 48-hour exposure to 50 \u03bcg/mL caused 73.8% apoptosis. This was associated with increased expression of Caspase 3, 8, 9, p53, Fas, FADD, Bax and Bak in a time-and dose-dependent manner, as determined by real- time quantitative PCR. In summary, the induction of apoptosis by FCE is effected by its ability to increase the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and the spice holds promise for consideration in complementary therapy for breast cancer patients.", "meta": {"pmid": 22471470}}
{"text": "The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) serves as a powerful predictor of tumor progression and overall survival in patients. Our previous studies showed that HOTAIR modulated HOXA1 DNA methylation by reducing DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression in drug-resistant small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Moreover, H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is catalyzed by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and plays a critical role in SCLC chemoresistance. However, it is not completely clear whether H3K27me3 affects HOXA1 DNA methylation or whether this effect is mediated by HOTAIR. The levels of EZH2 and H3K27me3 were identified in SCLC tissues by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and in SCLC multidrug-resistant cells by Western blotting. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were used to detect and analyze the biological function of H3K27me3. Then, we assessed the role of HOTAIR in the regulation of EZH2 and H3K27me3 by using lentivirus and small interfering RNA. Further, bisulfite sequencing PCR was conducted to detect the methylation levels of HOXA1 DNA. Finally, Western blotting was performed to examine the regulatory role of H3K27me3 in controlling HOTAIR expression in SCLC. In this study, we found that EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels were markedly higher in SCLC tissues and multidrug-resistant SCLC cells. The results indicated that H3K27me3 was related to multidrug resistance. HOTAIR overexpression and knockdown showed that EZH2 and H3K27me3 were regulated by HOTAIR. Moreover, H3K27me3 affected HOXA1 DNA methylation levels. Strikingly, we found that H3K27me3 acted as a negative feedback regulator of HOTAIR.

In this study, we identified and functionally characterized a Zn(II)2-Cys6 transcription factor FgAtrR in F. graminearum. We constructed a FgAtrR deletion mutant and found that deletion of FgAtrR resulted in faster radial growth with serious pigmentation defects, significantly reduced conidial production, and an inability to form perithecia. The pathogenicity of the \u0394FgAtrR mutant on wheat spikes and corn silks was severely impaired with reduced deoxynivalenol production, while the tolerance to prochloraz and propiconazole of the deletion mutant was also significantly decreased. RNA-seq indicated that many metabolic pathways were affected by the deletion of FgAtrR. Importantly, FgAtrR could regulate the expression of the FgCYP51A and ABC transporters, which are the main contributors to azole resistance. These results demonstrated that FgAtrR played essential roles in asexual and sexual development, DON production, and pathogenicity, and contributed to intrinsic resistance to azole fungicides in F. graminearum.

Under force-bearing conditions, increased biotinylation of \u03b1-actinin 1, \u03b1-actinin 4, and AFAP1 were detected, and these proteins accumulated along force-bearing actin fibers independently from zyxin, albeit at a lower intensity than zyxin. VASP also accumulated along force-bearing actin fibers in a zyxin-dependent manner, but the biotinylation of VASP remained constant regardless of force, supporting the model of a free zyxin-VASP complex in the cytoplasm being corecruited to tensed actin fibers. In addition, ARHGAP42, a RhoA GAP, was also identified as a proximal protein of zyxin and colocalized with zyxin along contractile actin bundles.

As we have reported previously, knockdown of SRSF3 increased the PDCD4 protein level in SW480 colon cancer cells. More interestingly, here we showed that the alternative splicing and the nuclear export of minor isoforms of pdcd4 mRNA were repressed by SRSF3, but the translation step was unaffected. In contrast, only the translation step of the major isoform of pdcd4 mRNA was repressed by SRSF3. Therefore, overexpression of SRSF3 might be relevant to the repression of all isoforms of PDCD4 protein levels in most types of cancer cell.

{"text": "Peripherin 2 (PRPH2) is a retina-specific tetraspanin protein essential for the formation of rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments (OS). Patients with mutations in PRPH2 exhibit severe retinal degeneration characterized by vast inter- and intra-familial phenotypic heterogeneity. To help understand contributors to this within-mutation disease variability, we asked whether the PRPH2 binding partner rod OS membrane protein 1 (ROM1) could serve as a phenotypic modifier. We utilized knockin and transgenic mouse models to evaluate the structural, functional and biochemical effects of eliminating one allele of Rom1 (Rom1+/-) in three different Prph2 models which mimic human disease: C213Y Prph2 (Prph2C/+), K153Del Prph2 (Prph2K/+) and R172W (Prph2R172W). Reducing Rom1 in the absence of Prph2 mutations (Rom1+/-) had no effect on retinal structure or function. However, the effects of reducing Rom1 in the presence of Prph2 mutations were highly variable. Prph2K/+/Rom1+/- mice had improved rod and cone function compared with Prph2K/+ as well as amelioration of K153Del-associated defects in PRPH2/ROM1 oligomerization. In contrast, Prph2R172W/Rom1+/- animals had worsened rod and cone function and exacerbated retinal degeneration compared with Prph2R172W animals. Removing one allele of Rom1 had no effect in Prph2C/+. Combined, our findings support a role for non-pathogenic ROM1 null variants in contributing to phenotypic variability in mutant PRPH2-associated retinal degeneration. Since the effects of Rom1 reduction are variable, our data suggest that this contribution is specific to the type of Prph2 mutation.", "meta": {"pmid": 32716032}}

The present study examined the influence of chronic administration (for 14days, via subcutaneously-implanted minipump) of antidepressant (AD) drugs representing three different classes (tricyclic [desipramine], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] [paroxetine], and monoamine oxidase inhibitor [MAOI] [phenelzine]) on mRNA for GAL, GAL receptors (GalR1, GalR2, and GalR3), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for NE synthesis, in four brain regions--LC, A1/C1, dorsal raphe (DRN), and ventral tegmentum (VTA) of rats. Consistent with previous findings that chronic administration of AD drugs decreases activity of LC neurons, administration of AD drugs reduced mRNA for both GAL and TH in LC neurons. GAL and TH mRNA in LC neurons was highly correlated. AD drugs also reduced GAL and TH mRNA in A1/C1 and VTA but effects were smaller than in LC. The largest change in mRNA for GAL receptors produced by AD administration was to decrease mRNA for GalR2 receptors in the VTA region. Also, mRNA for GalR2 and GalR3 receptors was significantly (positively) correlated in all three predominantly catecholaminergic brain regions (LC, A1/C1, and VTA). Relative to these three brain regions, unique effects were seen in the DRN region, with the SSRI elevating GAL mRNA and with mRNA for GalR1 and GalR3 being highly correlated in this brain region. The findings show that chronic administration of AD drugs, which produces effective antidepressant action, results in changes in mRNA for GAL, GAL receptors, and TH in brain regions that likely participate in depression and antidepressant effects.", "meta": {"pmid": 22317959}}
{"text": "Dynamin proteins are involved in vesicle generation, providing mechanical force to excise newly formed vesicles from membranes of cellular compartments. In the brain, dynamin-1, dynamin-2, and dynamin-3 have been well studied; however, their function in the retina remains elusive. A retina-specific splice variant of dynamin-1 interacts with the photoreceptor-specific protein Tubby-like protein 1 (Tulp1), which when mutated causes an early onset form of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we investigated the role of the dynamins in the retina, using immunohistochemistry to localize dynamin-1, dynamin-2, and dynamin-3 and immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to explore dynamin-1 interacting proteins in mouse retina. Dynamin-2 is primarily confined to the inner segment compartment of photoreceptors, suggesting a role in outer segment protein transport. Dynamin-3 is present in the terminals of photoreceptors and dendrites of second-order neurons but is most pronounced in the inner plexiform layer where second-order neurons relay signals from photoreceptors. Dynamin-1 appears to be the dominant isoform in the retina and is present throughout the retina and in multiple compartments of the photoreceptor cell. This suggests that it may function in multiple cellular pathways. Surprisingly, dynamin-1 expression and localization did not appear to be disrupted in tulp1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that dynamin-1 associates primarily with proteins involved in cytoskeletal-based membrane dynamics. This finding is confirmed by western blot analysis. Results further implicate dynamin-1 in vesicular protein transport processes relevant to synaptic and post-Golgi pathways and indicate a possible role in photoreceptor stability.", "meta": {"pmid": 23746204}}

Finally, MTC is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern in some families without associated pheochromocytomas or parathyroid hyperplasia (familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, MTC1(2). Sixty-one members of two well-characterized kindreds segregating MTC1 and 34 [corrected] members of six families segregating MEN2B were genotyped using a panel of RFLP probes from the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10 near a locus for MEN 2A. Statistically significant linkage was observed between the chromosome 10 centromere-specific marker D10Z1 and MTC1 (maximum pairwise lod score 5.88 with 0% recombination) and D10Z1 and MEN2B (maximum pairwise lod score 3.58 with 0% recombination). A maximum multipoint lod score of 4.08 was obtained for MEN2B at the position of D10Z1. In addition, 92 members of a previously unreported large MEN2A kindred were genotyped, and linkage to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10 is reported (maximum pairwise lod score of 11.33 with 0% recombination between MEN2A and RBP3). These results demonstrate that both a locus for familial MTC and a locus for MEN 2B map to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10, in the same region as a locus for MEN 2A.

{"text": "Septins are a family of GTP binding proteins that are well conserved in eukaryotic species except plants. Septins contribute to the lateral compartmentalization of membranes, cortical rigidity, and the regulation of membrane trafficking by associating with membrane lipids, actin, and microtubules. The organ of Corti in the cochlea has pivotal roles in auditory perception and includes two kinds of highly polarized cells, hair and supporting cells, both of which are rich in actin and microtubules. To identify the roles of septins in the cochlea, we analyzed the localization of three septin proteins, septin 4 (SEPT4), septin 5 (SEPT5), and septin 7 (SEPT7) that are abundantly expressed in brain tissues, and also examined auditory functions of Sept4 and Sept5 null mice. SEPT4, SEPT5, and SEPT7 were expressed in inner and outer pillar cells and Deiters' cells but the distribution patterns of each protein in Deiters' cells were different. SEPT4 and SEPT7 were expressed in the phalangeal process where SEPT5 was not detected. In addition to these cells SEPT5 and SEPT7 were co-localized with presynaptic vesicles of efferent nerve terminals. Only SEPT7 was expressed in the cochlea at embryonic stages. Although expression patterns of septin proteins suggested their important roles in the function of the cochlea, both Sept4 and Sept5 null mice had similar auditory functions to their wild type littermates. Immunohistochemical analysis of Sept4 null mice showed that compensatory expression of SEPT5 in the phalangeal process of Deiters' cells may have caused functional compensation of hearing ability in Sept4 null mice.", "meta": {"pmid": 22575789}}

In this current study, we investigated whether intravesical administration of miR-145 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling bladder cancer by using an orthotopic human bladder cancer xenograft model. Following transfection of 253J B-V cells with miR-145, the effects of the ectopic expression of miR-145 were examined by performing MTT, Western blotting analysis, Hoechst33342 staining, and wound healing assay in vitro. Also, a mouse orthotopic human bladder cancer model was established by inoculating 253J B-V cells into the bladder wall of mice. The anti-cancer effects of intravesical injections of miR-145 into these mice were then assessed. Transfection of 253J B-V cells with miR-145 induced apoptosis and suppression of cell migration in vitro. Western blotting showed that the levels of c-Myc, socs7, FSCN1, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, and catenin \u03b4-1 were decreased and that the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 signaling pathways were increased in compensatory fashion. In vivo, mice treated with miR-145 showed 76% inhibition of tumor growth, with a significant prolongation of animal survival (p = 0.0183 vs. control). Western blotting showed that both apoptosis and cell motility-related genes were significantly decreased as seen in vitro. Furthermore, PI3k/Akt and Erk1/2 signaling pathways, which were activated in a compensatory manner in vitro, were decreased in vivo.

{"text": "The mammalian kidney develops from the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme. In mice, the ureteric bud invades the metanephric mesenchyme at day E10.5 and begins to branch. The tips of the ureteric bud induce the metanephric mesenchyme to condense and form the cap mesenchyme. Some cells of this cap mesenchyme undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and differentiate into renal vesicles, which further develop into nephrons. The developing kidney expresses Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 20 and Fgf receptors Fgfr1 and Fgfr2. Fgf7 and Fgf10, mainly secreted by the metanephric mesenchyme, bind to Fgfr2b of the ureteric bud and induce branching. Fgfr1 and Fgfr2c are required for formation of the metanephric mesenchyme, however the two receptors can substitute for one another. Fgf8, secreted by renal vesicles, binds to Fgfr1 and supports survival of cells in the nascent nephrons. Fgf9 and Fgf20, expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme, are necessary to maintain survival of progenitor cells in the cortical region of the kidney. FgfrL1 is a novel member of the Fgfr family that lacks the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. It is expressed in the ureteric bud and all nephrogenic structures. Targeted deletion of FgfrL1 leads to severe kidney dysgenesis due to the lack of renal vesicles. FgfrL1 is known to interact mainly with Fgf8. It is therefore conceivable that FgfrL1 restricts signaling of Fgf8 to the precise location of the nascent nephrons. It might also promote tight adhesion of cells in the condensed metanephric mesenchyme as required for the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. ", "meta": {"pmid": 23112089}}

The expression of ACAT1 is ubiquitous, whereas that of ACAT2 is tissue restricted. Previous research indicates that ACAT1 may contain seven transmembrane domains (TMDs). To study ACAT2 topology, we inserted two different antigenic tags (hemagglutinin, monoclonal antibody Mab1) at various hydrophilic regions flanking each of its predicted TMDs, and expressed the recombinant proteins in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking endogenous ACAT. Each tagged ACAT2 was expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum as a single undegraded protein band and was at least partially active enzymatically. We then used cytoimmunofluorescence and protease protection assays to monitor the sidedness of the hemagglutinin and Mab1 tags along the ER membranes. The results indicated that ACAT2 contains only two detectable TMDs, located near the N terminal region. We also show that a conserved serine (S245), a candidate active site residue, is not essential for ACAT catalysis.

We previously reported that nicotine protects against mouse DSS colitis (similar to UC) by enhancing microRNA-124 (miR-124) expression. Intriguingly, elevation of miR-124 in CD is reported to aggravate the disease. Here we investigate the dual regulation of miR-124 in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which may explain the similar bidirectional regulation of tobacco. We found that overexpressed miR-124 protected against mouse DSS-induced colitis with a Th1 polarization in peripheral blood lymphocytes and colon tissues, which was also found in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Conversely, miR-124 knockdown worsened DSS murine colitis with a Th2 polarization. Moreover, knockdown of miR-124 could eliminate the polarization toward Th1 after nicotine treatment, suggesting that miR-124 mediates the effect of nicotine on the Th1/Th2 balance. In addition, interference of IL-6R, which is a downstream target of miR-124, could remarkably weaken the Th1 polarization induced by miR-124. Taken together, these results suggest that nicotine shifts the balance of Th1/Th2 toward Th1 via a miR-124-mediated IL-6R pathway, which might explain its dual role in IBDs.", "meta": {"pmid": 32153570}}

In the present paper we aim to investigate the levels of oxidative stress potentially induced by the oxidizing rodent renal carcinogen KBrO3 in ATM-defective lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from four classical AT patients (with different ATM mutations), one AT variant with reduced hypersensitivity to X rays, obligate AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control.

Treatments with KBrO3 clearly showed a marked hypersensitivity of the ATM-defective LCLs, including the AT variant. A marked and statistically significant reduction of KBrO3-induced chromosomal damage following inhibition of PARP by 3-AB, was observed in all AT LCLs, but not in those from the AT variant, AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control.

Slurp1 interaction with uPA was detected using ligand blots, ELISA, pull-down assays, and immunofluorescent staining. Stable expression of SLURP1 in HCLE cells was confirmed by immunoblots and immunofluorescent staining. Human corneal limbal epithelial and MK/T-1 cell proliferation and migration rates were suppressed by exogenous SLURP1. Ligand blots, ELISA, and pull-down assays indicated that Slurp1 efficiently interacts with uPA. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that exogenous SLURP1 decreased the amount of cell surface-bound uPA in the leading edges of migrating cells.

Two possible hypotheses on the decisive factors for anaerobic production of rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa were proposed, the strains specificity of rare P. aeruginosa (hypothesis 1) and the effect of specific substrates (hypothesis 2). This study assessed the anaerobic growth and rhamnolipids synthesis of three P. aeruginosa strains using different substrates. P. aeruginosa strains anaerobically grew well using all the tested substrates, but glycerol was the only carbon source that supported anaerobic production of rhamnolipids. Other carbon sources with different concentrations still failed for anaerobic production of rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa. Nitrate was the excellent nitrogen source for anaerobic production of rhamnolipids. FTIR spectra analysis confirmed the anaerobically produced rhamnolipids by P. aeruginosa using glycerol.

These drugs are distinctive in increasing blood lymphocytes while simultaneously shrinking enlarged lymph nodes, suggesting anatomical redistribution of CLL cells from lymph nodes into the blood. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. In this study, we showed that the egress receptor, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1), was expressed at low levels in normal germinal centers and CLL lymph nodes in vivo but became upregulated on normal B cells and, to a variable and lesser extent, CLL cells following in vitro incubation in S1P-free medium. Spontaneous recovery of S1PR1 expression on normal B and CLL cells was prevented by BCR cross-linking, whereas treatment of CLL cells with idelalisib increased S1PR1 expression and migration toward S1P, the greatest increase occurring in cases with unmutated IgH V region genes. Intriguingly, ibrutinib and fostamatinib had no effect on S1PR1 expression or function. Conversely, chemokine-induced migration, which requires integrin activation and is essential for the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes as well as their retention, was blocked by ibrutinib and fostamatinib, but not idelalisib. In summary, our results suggest that different BCR signaling inhibitors redistribute CLL cells from lymph nodes into the blood through distinct mechanisms: idelalisib actively promotes egress by upregulating S1PR1, whereas fostamatinib and ibrutinib may reduce CLL cell entry and retention by suppressing chemokine-induced integrin activation.

To identify genetic markers that are robustly associated across ethnic populations, numerous markers in addition to the six in the three reported loci were examined in this study. A total of 31 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were genotyped for 1115 Korean participants, and many neighboring SNPs were imputed using the Korean HapMap Project genotype data. Each SNP was statistically tested for association with POAG susceptibility by comparisons among 211 POAG patients with 904 unaffected controls. A strong and statistically significant association was found with a previously unreported SNP, rs7098387 (odds ratio, OR=2.0 (1.4-3.0), P=0.00038) at the 10p12.31 locus (where 11 SNPs were typed and 38 imputed) in contrast to the reported rs7081455, which was too poorly correlated with newly associated rs7098387 (r2=0.003, D'=0.40) to show association. Additionally, a modest association was observed with the reported rs693421 (OR=1.4 (1.1-1.7), P=0.0082) and several other SNPs located within and around ZP4 at the 1q43 locus (10 SNPs typed and 14 imputed). However, no association was observed with the reported rs7961953 SNP or any other SNPs at the 12q21.31 locus, upstream of TMTC2 (10 SNPs typed and 29 imputed). Accordingly, POAG susceptibility association was replicated using rs7098387 (C) rather than rs7081455 (T) at the 10p12.31 locus and additionally with rs693421 (T) at the 1q43 locus.", "meta": {"pmid": 23838595}}
{"text": "For osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary malignant bone tumor, overall survival has hardly improved over the last four decades. Especially for metastatic OS, novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. A hallmark of cancer is aberrant metabolism, which justifies targeting metabolic pathways as a promising therapeutic strategy. One of these metabolic pathways, the NAD+ synthesis pathway, can be considered as a potential target for OS treatment. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the classical salvage pathway for NAD+ synthesis, and NAMPT is overexpressed in OS. In this study, five OS cell lines were treated with the NAMPT inhibitor FK866, which was shown to decrease nuclei count in a 2D in vitro model without inducing caspase-driven apoptosis. The reduction in cell viability by FK866 was confirmed in a 3D model of OS cell lines (n = 3). Interestingly, only OS cells with low nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase domain containing 1 (NAPRT1) RNA expression were sensitive to NAMPT inhibition. Using a publicly available (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)) and a previously published dataset, it was shown that in OS cell lines and primary tumors, low NAPRT1 RNA expression correlated with NAPRT1 methylation around the transcription start site. These results suggest that targeting NAMPT in osteosarcoma could be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy, where low NAPRT expression can serve as a biomarker for the selection of eligible patients.", "meta": {"pmid": 34200964}}
{"text": "The tendon is highly prone to injury, overuse, or age-related degeneration in both humans and horses. Natural healing of injured tendon is poor, and cell-based therapeutic treatment is still a significant clinical challenge. In this study, we extensively investigated the expression of tenogenic genes in equine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and tenocyte-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (teno-iPSCs) stimulated by growth factors (TGF-\u03b23 and BMP12) combined with ectopic expression of tenogenic transcription factor MKX or cyclic uniaxial mechanical stretch. Western blotting revealed that TGF-\u03b23 and BMP12 increased the expression of transcription factors SCX and MKX in both cells, but the tenocyte marker tenomodulin (TNMD) was detected only in BMSCs and upregulated by either inducer. On the other hand, quantitative real-time PCR showed that TGF-\u03b23 increased the expression of EGR1, COL1A2, FMOD, and TNC in BMSCs and SCX, COL1A2, DCN, FMOD, and TNC in teno-iPSCs. BMP12 treatment elevated SCX, MKX, DCN, FMOD, and TNC in teno-iPSCs. Overexpression of MKX increased SCX, DCN, FMOD, and TNC in BMSCs and EGR1, COL1A2, DCN, FMOD, and TNC in teno-iPSCs; TGF-\u03b23 further enhanced TNC in BMSCs. Moreover, mechanical stretch increased SCX, EGR1, DCN, ELN, and TNC in BMSCs and SCX, MKX, EGR1, COL1A2, DCN, FMOD, and TNC in teno-iPSCs; TGF-\u03b23 tended to further elevate SCX, ELN, and TNC in BMSCs and SCX, MKX, COL1A2, DCN, and TNC in teno-iPSCs, while BMP12 further uptrended the expression of SCX and DCN in BMSCs and DCN in teno-iPSCs. Additionally, the aforementioned tenogenic inducers also affected the expression of signaling regulators SMAD7, ETV4, and SIRT1 in BMSCs and teno-iPSCs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that, in respect to the tenocyte-lineage-specific gene expression, BMSCs and teno-iPSCs respond differently to the tenogenic stimuli, which may affect the outcome of their application in tendon repair or regeneration.", "meta": {"pmid": 33510795}}
{"text": "The melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R) expressed in melanocytes is a major determinant of skin pigmentation. It encodes a Gs protein-coupled receptor activated by \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1MSH). Human MC1R has an inefficient poly(A) site allowing intergenic splicing with its downstream neighbour Tubulin-\u03b2-III (TUBB3). Intergenic splicing produces two MC1R isoforms, designated Iso1 and Iso2, bearing the complete seven transmembrane helices from MC1R fused to TUBB3-derived C-terminal extensions, in-frame for Iso1 and out-of-frame for Iso2. It has been reported that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) might promote an isoform switch from canonical MC1R (MC1R-001) to the MC1R-TUBB3 chimeras, which might lead to novel phenotypes required for tanning. We expressed the Flag epitope-tagged intergenic isoforms in heterologous HEK293T cells and human melanoma cells, for functional characterization. Iso1 was expressed with the expected size. Iso2 yielded a doublet of Mr significantly lower than predicted, and impaired intracellular stability. Although Iso1- and Iso2 bound radiolabelled agonist with the same affinity as MC1R-001, their plasma membrane expression was strongly reduced. Decreased surface expression mostly resulted from aberrant forward trafficking, rather than high rates of endocytosis. Functional coupling of both isoforms to cAMP was lower than wild-type, but ERK activation upon binding of \u03b1MSH was unimpaired, suggesting imbalanced signaling from the splice variants. Heterodimerization of differentially labelled MC1R-001 with the splicing isoforms analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation was efficient and caused decreased surface expression of binding sites. Thus, UVR-induced MC1R isoforms might contribute to fine-tune the tanning response by modulating MC1R-001 availability and functional parameters. ", "meta": {"pmid": 26657157}}

These results have indicated that XAB2 is involved in TCR and transcription. In this report, to elucidate the function of XAB2 in vivo, two types of mutations were introduced into the XAB2 gene in mice: a deletion of the region encompassing the promoter and exons 1-4, and a deletion of the C-terminal 162 amino acids. Both types of XAB2-heterozygous mice appeared normal physiologically and behaviorally. However, XAB2-homozygotes were selectively absent among the newborn mice. A detailed analysis of embryos at different stages of development indicated that the XAB2-homozygous mutants could survive until the morula stage, but could not develop to the blastocyst stage.

A total of 1,432 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from 766 cancer-related genes were genotyped with partially degraded genomic DNAs isolated from these samples. This directly targeted genomic profiling identified not only previously reported somatic gene amplifications (e.g., CCND1) and deletions (e.g., CDKN2A and CDKN2B) but also novel genomic aberrations. Among these novel targets, the most frequently deleted genomic regions were chromosome 3p (including tumor suppressor genes FANCD2 and CTNNB1) and chromosome 5 (including tumor suppressor gene APC). The most frequently amplified genomic region was chromosome 3q (containing DVL3, MLF1, ABCC5, BCL6, AGTR1 and known oncogenes TNK2, TNFSF10, FGF12). The chromosome 3p deletion and 3q amplification occurred coincidently in nearly all of the affected cases, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the generation of somatic chromosomal aberrations. We also detected significant differences in germline allele frequency between the esophageal cohort of our study and normal control samples from the International HapMap Project for 10 genes (CSF1, KIAA1804, IL2, PMS2, IRF7, FLT3, NTRK2, MAP3K9, ERBB2 and PRKAR1A), suggesting that they might play roles in esophageal cancer susceptibility and/or development.

Polymorphic DNA markers for nine sarcomeric genes for DCM and/or HCM were tested for segregation with disease. Linkage to eight genes was excluded, but a cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) marker cosegregated with the disease phenotype. Sequencing of TNNT2 identified a heterozygous missense mutation resulting in an I79N substitution, inherited by all nine affected family members but by none of the six unaffected relatives.

However, the pharmacologic relevance of ABCC4 at the BBB is difficult to evaluate, as most drugs are also substrates of ABCB1 and/or ABCG2. We have created a mouse strain in which all these alleles are inactivated to assess their impact on brain delivery of camptothecin analogues, an important class of antineoplastic agents and substrates of these transporters. Wild-type (WT), Abcg2(-/-), Abcb1a/b(-/-), Abcc4(-/-), Abcb1a/b;Abcg2(-/-), Abcg2;Abcc4(-/-), and Abcb1a/b;Abcg2;Abcc4(-/-) mice received i.v. topotecan, irinotecan, SN-38, or gimatecan alone or with concomitant oral elacridar. Drug levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We found that additional deficiency of Abcc4 in Abcb1a/b;Abcg2(-/-) mice significantly increased the brain concentration of all camptothecin analogues by 1.2-fold (gimatecan) to 5.8-fold (SN-38). The presence of Abcb1a/b or Abcc4 alone was sufficient to reduce the brain concentration of SN-38 to the level in WT mice. Strikingly, the brain distribution of gimatecan in brain of WT mice was more than 220- and 40-fold higher than that of SN-38 and topotecan, respectively. Abcc4 limits the brain penetration of camptothecin analogues and teams up with Abcb1a/b and Abcg2 to form a robust cooperative drug efflux system. This concerted action limits the usefulness of selective ABC transport inhibitors to enhance drug entry for treatment of intracranial diseases.

{"text": "Although genome-wide association studies have identified the gene RNF186 encoding an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase as conferring susceptibility to ulcerative colitis, the exact function of this protein remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for RNF186 in macroautophagy/autophagy activation in colonic epithelial cells and intestinal homeostasis. Mechanistically, RNF186 acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase for EPHB2 and regulates the ubiquitination of EPHB2. Upon stimulation by ligand EFNB1 (ephrin B1), EPHB2 is ubiquitinated by RNF186 at Lys892, and further recruits MAP1LC3B for autophagy. Compared to control mice, rnf186-/- and ephb2-/- mice have a more severe phenotype in the DSS-induced colitis model, which is due to a defect in autophagy in colon epithelial cells. More importantly, treatment with ephrin-B1-Fc recombinant protein effectively relieves DSS-induced mouse colitis, which suggests that ephrin-B1-Fc may be a potential therapy for human inflammatory bowel diseases.Abbreviations: ACTB: actin beta; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG16L1: autophagy related 16 like 1; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; Cas9: CRISPR associated protein 9; CD: Crohn disease; CQ: chloroquine; Csf2: colony stimulating factor 2; Cxcl1: c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 1; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; DSS: dextran sodium sulfate; EFNB1: ephrin B1; EPHB2: EPH receptor B2; EPHB3: EPH receptor B3; EPHB2K788R: lysine 788 mutated to arginine in EPHB2; EPHB2K892R: lysine 892 mutated to arginine in EPHB2; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GWAS: genome-wide association studies; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; HSPA5/BiP: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5; IBD: inflammatory bowel diseases; Il1b: interleukin 1 beta; Il6: interleukin 6; IRGM:immunity related GTPase M; i.p.: intraperitoneally; IPP: inorganic pyrophosphatase; KD: knockdown; KO: knockout; MAP1LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; NOD2: nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PtdIns3K: class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RNF186: ring finger protein 186; RNF186A64T: alanine 64 mutated to threonine in RNF186; RNF186R179X: arginine 179 mutated to X in RNF186; RPS6: ribosomal protein S6; Tnf: tumor necrosis factor; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; Ub: ubiquitin; UBE2D2: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 D2; UBE2H: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 H; UBE2K: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 K; UBE2N: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N; UC: ulcerative colitis; ULK1:unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild type.", "meta": {"pmid": 33280498}}

Interestingly, PGRMC1 is expressed at several intracellular locations, including the nucleolus. The aim of this study is to investigate the functional relationship between PGRMC1 and nucleolus. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed PGRMC1's nucleolar localization in cultured bovine granulosa cells (bGC) and oocytes. Additional experiments conducted on bGC revealed that PGRMC1 co-localizes with nucleolin (NCL), a major nucleolar protein. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing experiments showed that when PGRMC1 expression was depleted, NCL translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Similarly, oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, reduced PGRMC1 immunofluorescent signal in the nucleolus and increased NCL nucleoplasmic signal, when compared to non-treated cells. Although PGRMC1 influenced NCL localization, a direct interaction between these two proteins was not detected using in situ proximity ligation assay. This suggests the involvement of additional molecules in mediating the co-localization of PGRMC1 and nucleolin. Since nucleolin translocates into the nucleoplasm in response to various cellular stressors, PGRMC1's ability to regulate its localization within the nucleolus is likely an important component of mechanism by which cells response to stress. This concept is consistent with PGRMC1's well-described ability to promote ovarian cell survival and provides a rationale for future studies on PGRMC1, NCL and the molecular mechanism by which these two proteins protect against the adverse effect of cellular stressors, including oxidative stress.", "meta": {"pmid": 29339453}}

Several studies have supported the efficacy of cyclosporin in preventing graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation. Cyclosporin is also possibly effective in treating diseases of autoimmune origin and as an antineoplastic agent. The introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring of cyclosporin was extremely useful because of the wide inter- and intraindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin after oral or intravenous administration. Optimal long term use of cyclosporin requires careful monitoring of the blood (or plasma) concentrations. Sustained and clinically significant drug-drug interactions can occur during long term therapy with cyclosporin. The coadministration of multiple drugs with cyclosporin could result in graft rejection, renal dysfunction or other undesirable effects.

Most importantly, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that mediate many drug:drug interactions are not involved in the biotransformation of ximelagatran to melagatran. No significant pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed when oral ximelagatran is administered with a range of agents, including diclofenac, diazepam, nifedipine, digoxin, atorvastatin, or amiodarone. The low potential for drug:drug interactions with ximelagatran is also supported by an analysis of the pharmacokinetic data from clinical studies in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving long-term treatment with oral ximelagatran. Increases of mean melagatran area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax) of up to approximately 80% have been observed when ximelagatran is co-administered with the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin or azithromycin, and the mechanism for this interaction is currently under investigation. The bioavailability of melagatran is not altered by co-administration with food or alcohol. The melagatran-induced prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), an ex vivo coagulation time assay used as a measure of thrombin inhibition, is not altered by other drugs [including digoxin, atorvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and amiodarone], food, or alcohol. The effect of melagatran on capillary bleeding time, which is prolonged as a result of the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, is relatively low and additive to the platelet-inhibitory effect of ASA.", "meta": {"pmid": 16123912}}
{"text": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is curable only in early stages by complete surgical resection. Thus, in advanced disease stages in which a complete removal of the tumor mass is no longer possible and palliative chemotherapy achieves only modest success, therapeutics employing new methods of action are desperately needed. Oncolytic viruses employed in clinical studies have been shown to spread preferentially in cancer cells. Beyond that, virotherapeutic cell killing can be enhanced by virus-based expression of suicide genes. We engineered a measles vaccine virus (MeV) vector expressing super cytosine deaminase (SCD), a fusion protein of yeast cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and subsequently to 5-fluorouridine-monophosphate. This novel vector was evaluated using three different human-derived CC cell lines. In vitro, all CC cell lines were found to be permissive to MeV infection. Partial blocking of MeV-mediated oncolysis could be overcome by employment of the SCD transgene together with administration of 5-FC. In vivo, intratumoral application of SCD-armed MeV together with a systemic 5-FC treatment showed a significant reduction in tumor size in a TFK-1 xenograft mouse model when compared with virus-only treatment. In a second animal experiment employing a HuCCT1 xenograft tumor model, an enhanced SCD-armed MeV vector, in which the SCD transgene was expressed from a different genomic position, led not only to reduced tumor volumes, but also to a significant survival benefit. On the basis of these encouraging preclinical data on employment of SCD-armed MeV for the virotherapeutic treatment of chemotherapy-resistant CC, a clinical virotherapy trial is set up currently.", "meta": {"pmid": 23550539}}
{"text": "Several C1q family members, related to the C1q complement component are extensively expressed in the central nervous system. Cbln1, which belongs to the Cbln subfamily of C1q proteins and released from cerebellar granule cells, plays an indispensable role in the synapse formation and function at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. This is achieved by formation of a trans-synaptic tripartite complex which is composed of one unit of the Cbln1 hexamer, monomeric neurexin (NRX) containing a splice site 4 insertion at presynaptic terminals and the postsynaptic GluD2 dimers. Recently an increasing number of soluble or transmembrane proteins have been identified to bind directly to the amino-terminal domains of iGluR and regulate the recruitment and function of iGluRs at synapses. Especially at mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus, postsynaptic kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs) are involved in synaptic network activity through their characteristic channel kinetics. C1ql2 and C1ql3, which belong to the C1q-like subfamily of C1q proteins, are produced by MFs and serve as extracellular organizers to recruit functional postsynaptic KAR complexes at MF-CA3 synapses via binding to the amino-terminal domains of GluK2 and GluK4 KAR subunits. In addition, C1ql2 and C1ql3 directly bind to NRX3 containing sequences encoded by exon 25b insertion at splice site 5. In the present review, we highlighted the generality of the strategy by tripartite complex formation of the specific type of NRX and iGluR via C1q family members.", "meta": {"pmid": 27845167}}
{"text": "RecJ was originally identified in Escherichia coli and plays an important role in the DNA repair and recombination pathways. Thermococcus kodakarensis, a hyperthermophilic archaeon, has two RecJ-like nucleases. These proteins are designated as GAN (GINS-associated nuclease) and HAN (Hef-associated nuclease), based on the protein they interact with. GAN is probably a counterpart of Cdc45 in the eukaryotic CMG replicative helicase complex. HAN is considered mainly to function with Hef for restoration of the stalled replication fork. In this study, we characterized HAN to clarify its functions in Thermococcus cells. HAN showed single-strand specific 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, which was stimulated in the presence of Hef. A gene disruption analysis revealed that HAN was non-essential for viability, but the \u0394gan\u0394han double mutant did not grow under optimal conditions at 85\u2009\u00b0C. This deficiency was not fully recovered by introducing the mutant han gene, encoding the nuclease-deficient HAN protein, back into the genome. These results suggest that the unstable replicative helicase complex without GAN performs ineffective fork progression, and thus the stalled fork repair system including HAN becomes more important. The nuclease activity of HAN is required for the function of this protein in T. kodakarensis.", "meta": {"pmid": 29209094}}
{"text": "Information on the role of resistin on steroidogenesis is limited to animal studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of various doses of resistin on estradiol and progesterone secretion from human luteinized granulosa cells in culture. Granulosa cells were obtained from follicular fluid aspirated from 50 women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The cells were cultured for 48 h after a 24 h pre-incubation period. The effect of resistin at dosages 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml alone or in combinations with FSH (10 and 100 ng/ml) on steroidogenesis was investigated. Estradiol and progesterone were measured by radioimmunoassays in culture supernatants at 24 h and 48 h. FSH treatment increased both estradiol and progesterone secretion. Resistin suppressed basal estradiol (at 1 ng/ml) and progesterone secretion (at all concentrations tested). When resistin (all concentrations) was combined with FSH (100 ng/ml), it eliminated the stimulatory effect of FSH on the secretion of estradiol and progesterone. This study indicates an inhibitory effect of resistin on the secretion of estradiol and progesterone by human luteinized granulosa cells in vitro.

It was first described by Hartley in 1964 as an inflammation of the longus colli muscle secondary to calcium crystals deposition on its insertion. The calcifications are mostly located on the oblique portion of the muscle at the level of C1-C2. Methods. We will describe this disease through 4 cases that presented in our institution. Results. The most common symptoms are severe neck pain, odynophagia, and a painful restriction of neck movement. It is associated with mild fever and inflammatory lab findings such as a slight elevation of white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. CT scan is recommended as the first-line imaging modality to establish a diagnosis. Treatments consist of NSAIDs and analgesics to accelerate the healing process. If symptoms are severe, a course of corticosteroids is required. Conclusion. Since the clinical and laboratory findings of this condition and those of a retropharyngeal abscess overlap, it is important to establish the right diagnosis in order to prevent more invasive procedures. A good knowledge of this clinical entity by otolaryngologists would prevent delays in hospital discharge and unnecessary anxiety. ", "meta": {"pmid": 23862089}}
{"text": "The scarcity of human islets for transplantation remains a major limitation of cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells are of interest because they can be isolated, expanded and offered for such therapy under autologous/allogeneic settings. We characterized and compared human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (hBMC) obtained from (second trimester), young (1-24 years) and adult (34-81 years) donors. We propose a novel protocol that involves assessment of paracrine factors from regenerating pancreas in differentiation and maturation of hBMC into endocrine pancreatic lineage in vivo. We observed that donor age was inversely related to growth potential of hBMC. Following in vitro expansion and exposure to specific growth factors involved in pancreatic development, hBMC migrated and formed islet-like cell aggregates (ICA). ICA show increased abundance of pancreatic transcription factors (Ngn3, Brn4, Nkx6.1, Pax6 and Isl1). Although efficient differentiation was not achieved in vitro, we observed significant maturation and secretion of human c-peptide (insulin) upon transplantation into pancreactomized and Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Transplanted ICA responded to glucose and maintained normoglycemia in diabetic mice. Our data demonstrate that hBMC have tremendous in vitro expansion potential and can be differentiated into multiple lineages, including the endocrine pancreatic lineage. Paracrine factors secreted from regenerating pancreas help in efficient differentiation and maturation of hBMC, possibly via recruiting chromatin modulators, to generate glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 21039304}}

Both reagents show little reactivity with blood and bone marrow nucleated cells but define a major (TH-111: 78.3%) or an important (TC-12: 45.6%) subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression of TC-12 was found in 64 (20.2%) of 317 and TH-111 in 97 (29.1%) of 333 of these patients.

{"text": "Background: Recurrence remains one of the key reasons of relapse after the radical radiation for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, the multiple molecular and clinical variables integrated decision tree algorithms were designed to predict individual recurrence patterns (with VS without recurrence) for locally advanced NPC. Methods: A total of 136 locally advanced NPC patients retrieved from a randomized controlled phase III trial, were included. For each patient, the expression levels of 33 clinicopathological biomarkers in tumor specimen, 3 Epstein-Barr virus related serological antibody titer and 5 clinicopathological variables, were detected and collected to construct the decision tree algorithm. The expression level of 33 clinicopathological biomarkers in tumor specimen was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining. Results: Three algorithm classifiers, augmented by the adaptive boosting algorithm for variable selection and classification, were designed to predict individual recurrence pattern. The classifiers were trained in the training subset and further tested using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme in the validation subset. In total, 13 molecules expression level in tumor specimen, including AKT1, Aurora-A, Bax, Bcl-2, N-Cadherin, CENP-H, HIF-1\u03b1, LMP-1, C-Met, MMP-2, MMP-9, Pontin and Stathmin, and N stage were selected to construct three 10-fold cross-validation decision tree classifiers. These classifiers showed high predictive sensitivity (87.2-93.3%), specificity (69.0-100.0%), and overall accuracy (84.5-95.2%) to predict recurrence pattern individually. Multivariate analyses confirmed the decision tree classifier was an independent prognostic factor to predict individual recurrence (algorithm 1: hazard ration (HR) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.16, P < 0.01; algorithm 2: HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.44, P < 0.01; algorithm 3: HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.68, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Multiple molecular and clinicopathological variables integrated decision tree algorithms may individually predict the recurrence pattern for locally advanced NPC.

In particular, the CYP4 family plays an essential role in lipid metabolism by the \u03c9-hydroxylation of terminal ends of fatty acids. Disturbance of this system has been associated with increased angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis of several cancers. This study aimed to detect the expression of CYP4 isoforms (CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F3) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and their association with clinicopathological features. Pancreatic specimens were collected from 73 patients who underwent surgical resection at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the cytochrome P450 isoforms in PDA (n = 62), adjacent-normal (n = 30), and benign tissues (n = 11). Logistic regression models were used to analyze gene expression among tissue types. Spearman rank correlations were calculated for isoform expression and for age. Differences in expression by gender were assessed via t test. Other clinicopathological variables (diabetes, smoking, obesity, T stage, perineural invasion, nodal status) were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum. CYP4 expression for isoforms was significantly higher in PDA tissues versus matched-adjacent tissues (p < 0.01). PDA tumors expressed significantly higher levels of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 when compared to benign lesions (p < 0.01). Significant associations were found between low levels of CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 and increased age of PDA patients. Interestingly, all isoforms were expressed at higher levels in male patients.

{"text": "The purpose of this study is to understand whether isoprostane, a biomarker of oxidative stress, is subject to heritable control; whether it shares heritability with other cardiometabolic risk traits; and finally whether genetic variation at a specific candidate locus contributes to isoprostane variability. Isoprostane marks oxidative stress, and elevated isoprostane excretion might be involved in cardiovascular target organ damage. Here we used the classical twin pair method to probe the role of heredity in generating the isoprostane trait. Trait heritability (h(2)) and shared genetic determination among traits (pleiotropy, genetic covariance, \u03c1(G)) were estimated by variance components in twin pairs. Because the isoprostane and Chromogranin B (CHGB) traits shared \u03c1(G), we examined the CHGB locus for effects on the traits. Urinary isoprostane excretion was substantially heritable (h(2) = 65.8 \u00b1 4.3%), and the isoprostane trait aggregated with multiple traits (CHGB, catecholamines, autonomic/baroreceptor, and renal function), including several features of the metabolic syndrome (body mass index, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia). Isoprostane excretion also aggregated with systemic hypertension. Twin studies demonstrated genetic covariance (pleiotropy) for the isoprostane and CHGB traits (\u03c1(G) = 0.27), and therefore we investigated the CHGB locus for trait effects. A common variant in the 3'-UTR of CHGB (C+84A) associated with plasma CHGB as well as isoprostane excretion. The C+84A disrupted an A/U-rich messenger ribonucleic acid stability element, and in transfected luciferase/3'-UTR plasmids, the C+84 and +84A alleles differed markedly in reporter expression in chromaffin and neuroblastoma cells, whereas site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of this variant within the context of the A/U-rich motif. Isoprostane excretion is substantially heritable and shares joint genetic determination with CHGB as well as multiple features of the metabolic syndrome. A common polymorphism in the 3'-UTR (C+84A) of CHGB, which disrupts an A/U-rich messenger ribonucleic acid stability element, associates with not only CHGB secretion but also excretion of isoprostane. We propose a chain of events whereby CHGB genetic variation results in oxidative stress, with isoprostane formation.

{"text": "Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is one of the most abundant CYP enzymes in the human liver. CYP2C9 metabolizes more than 100 therapeutic drugs, including tolbutamide, glyburide, diclofenac, celecoxib, torasemide, phenytoin losartan, and S-warfarin). Some natural and herbal compounds are also metabolized by CYP2C9, probably leading to the formation of toxic metabolites. CYP2C9 also plays a role in the metabolism of several endogenous compounds such as steroids, melatonin, retinoids and arachidonic acid. Many CYP2C9 substrates are weak acids, but CYP2C9 also has the capacity to metabolise neutral, highly lipophilic compounds. A number of ligand-based and homology models of CYP2C9 have been reported and this has provided insights into the binding of ligands to the active site of CYP2C9. Data from the site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that a number of residues (e.g. Arg97, Phe110, Val113, Phe114, Arg144, Ser286, Asn289, Asp293 and Phe476) play an important role in ligand binding and determination of substrate specificity. The resolved crystal structures of CYP2C9 have confirmed the importance of these residues in substrate recognition and ligand orientation. CYP2C9 is activated by dapsone and its analogues and R-lansoprazole in a stereo-specific and substrate-dependent manner, probably through binding to the active site and inducing positive cooperativity. CYP2C9 is subject to induction by rifampin, phenobarbital, and dexamethasone, indicating the involvement of pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in the regulation of CYP2C9. A number of compounds have been found to inhibit CYP2C9 and this may provide an explanation for some clinically important drug interactions. Tienilic acid, suprofen and silybin are mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP2C9. Given the critical role of CYP2C9 in drug metabolism and the presence of polymorphisms, it is important to identify drug candidates as potential substrates, inducer or inhibitors of CYP2C9 in drug development and drug discovery scientists should develop drugs with minimal interactions with this enzyme.

In contrast, even when the requirement for lowering of serum urate levels was waived, only 2 of 24 (8.3%) subjects without persistent lowering of urate levels and 0 of 43 subjects receiving placebo met criteria. Mixed modeling indicated that in addition to urate levels, assessment of tophi, swollen joints, and tender joints and patient global assessment best correlated with time to maximum benefit. Using these criteria of CR, 23 of the responders (71.9%) met the criteria. All patients who achieved a CR maintained it for a mean duration of 507.4 days. Finally, 64% of persistent responders to monthly pegloticase also met criteria for CR. These results have validated the proposed remission criteria for gout and have helped define criteria for CR in individuals with chronic gout treated with pegloticase.

CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times).

{"text": "Prenatal alcohol exposure causes distinctive craniofacial anomalies that arise, in part, from the apoptotic elimination of neural crest (NC) progenitors that form the face. This vulnerability of NC to alcohol is puzzling as they normally express the transcriptional repressor Snail1/2 (in chick Snai2), which suppresses apoptosis and promotes their migration. Here, we investigate alcohol's impact upon Snai2 function. Chick cranial NC cells were treated with acute alcohol (52\u2009mM, 2 hr). We evaluated NC migration, gene expression, proliferation, and apoptosis thereafter. Transient alcohol exposure induced Snai2 (191%\u2009\u00b1\u200923%; p\u2009=\u2009.003) and stimulated NC migration (p\u2009=\u2009.0092). An alcohol-induced calcium transient mediated this Snai2 induction, and BAPTA-AM blocked whereas ionomycin mimicked these pro-migratory effects. Alcohol suppressed CyclinD1 protein content (59.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912%, p\u2009=\u2009.007) and NC proliferation (19.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8%, p\u2009<\u2009.001), but these Snai2-enriched cells still apoptosed in response to alcohol. This was explained because alcohol induced p53 (198\u2009\u00b1\u200929%, p\u2009=\u2009.023), and the p53 antagonist pifithrin-\u03b1 prevented their apoptosis. Moreover, alcohol counteracted Snai2's pro-survival signals, and Bcl2 was repressed (68.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0% of controls, p\u2009=\u2009.016) and PUMA was not induced, while ATM (1.32-fold, p\u2009=\u2009.01) and PTEN (1.30-fold, p\u2009=\u2009.028) were elevated. Alcohol's calcium transient uncouples the Snai2/p53 regulatory loop that normally prevents apoptosis during EMT. This represents a novel pathway in alcohol's neurotoxicity, and complements demonstrations that alcohol suppresses PUMA in mouse NC. We propose that the NCs migratory behavior, and their requirement for Snai2/p53 co-expression, makes them vulnerable to stressors that dysregulate Snai2/p53 interactions, such as alcohol.", "meta": {"pmid": 31021056}}

Although its action is mostly directed at the regulation of cholinergic transmission, galantamine can also afford neuroprotection against amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which is involved in AD pathogenesis. In this study, we used cultured rat cortical neurons treated with two forms of Abeta(1-40), fresh and previously aged (enriched in fibrils). First, we confirmed that galantamine prevented neurodegeneration induced by both peptide forms in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, we observed that when neurons were co-incubated with fresh Abeta(1-40) plus galantamine, the amount of amyloid aggregates was reduced. As oxidative conditions influence Abeta aggregation, we investigated whether galantamine prevents oxidative stress induced by this peptide. The data show that either fresh or aged Abeta(1-40) significantly increased the amount of reactive oxygen species and lipoperoxidation, these effects being prevented by galantamine. In Abeta(1-40)-treated neurons, the depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) seems to be related to the decrease in glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities(.) These alterations in the GSH antioxidant system were prevented by galantamine. Overall, these results constitute the first evidence that galantamine can prevent the neuronal oxidative damage induced by Abeta, providing an in vitro basis for the beneficial actions of galantamine in the AD neurodegenerative process.", "meta": {"pmid": 19222556}}

In this study, we have used standard molecular approaches to analyze markers of these processes in primarily in vitro cultured porcine granulosa, subjected to conditions usually applied to cultures of similar cells. The material for our research came from commercially slaughtered pigs. The cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion of tissues and in vitro culture in appropriate conditions. The obtained genetic material (RNA) was collected at specific time intervals (0 h-before culture; reference, 48, 98, 144 h) and then analyzed using expression microarrays. Genes that showed a fold change greater than |2| and an adjusted p value lower than 0.05 were described as differentially expressed. Three groups of genes: \"Cell morphogenesis\", \"cell differentiation\" and \"cell development\" were analyzed. From 265 differently expressed genes that belong to chosen ontology groups we have selected DAPL1, CXCL10, NEBL, IHH, TGFBR3, SCUBE1, DAB1, ITM2A, MCOLN3, IGF1 which are most downregulated and PDPN, CAV1, TMOD1, TAGLN, IGFBP5, ITGB3, LAMB1, FN1, ITGA2, POSTN genes whose expression is upregulated through the time of culture, on which we focused in downstream analysis. The results were also validated using RT-qPCR. The aim of our work was to conduct primary in vitro culture of granulosa cells, as well as to analyze the expression of gene groups in relation to the proliferation of follicular granulosa cells in the model of primary culture in real time. This knowledge should provide us with a molecular insight into the processes occurring during the in vitro cultures of porcine granulosa cells, serving as a basic molecular entry on the extent of the loss of their physiological properties, as well as gain of new, culture-specific traits.", "meta": {"pmid": 31443152}}

Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of membranous ABCC2 and metabolic proteins, DCK, TK1, and TK2 in tumor cells. Animal models were used to confirm the treatment efficacy of phytochemicals in combination with gemcitabine to bladder cancer. The observed/expected ratio of cytotoxicity analysis revealed that capsaicin has synergistic effect with gemcitabine to T24-GCB cells in a dose-dependent pattern. Quercetin, curcumin, and resveratrol have additive effect with gemcitabine to T24-GCB cells. Capsaicin and quercetin alone and combination with gemcitabine decreased the expression of ABCC2 and DCK and TKs, in T24-GCB cells. On the contrary, resveratrol and curcumin alone and combination with gemcitabine increased the expression of ABCC2 but decreased cytoplasmic kinases simultaneously. In xenografted subcutaneous tumor model on nude mice, combination treatment of capsaicin and gemcitabine demonstrated the highest tumor suppression effect when compared to capsaicin or gemcitabine treatment alone. The MDR of bladder cancer is closely related to membranous ABCC2, cytoplasmic DCK, and TKs expression. Capsaicin owns the strongest synergistic cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine to T24-GCB cells. This combination regimen may provide as an adjunctive treatment for overcoming MDR in bladder cancer.", "meta": {"pmid": 33280258}}

The patient had hyponatremia, serum cortisol <1.0 ug/dL, ACTH of 807 pg/mL and aldosterone <3\u00a0ng/dL. Computed tomography (CT) findings of adrenal enlargement with no parenchymal and minimal peripheral capsular enhancement after contrast were consistent with bilateral adrenal infarction. The patient had autoimmune hepatitis and positive antiphospholipid antibodies, but no previous thrombotic events. The patient was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone, followed by oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Among 115 articles, we identified nine articles, including case reports, of new-onset adrenal insufficiency and/or adrenal hemorrhage/infarction on CT in COVID-19. Adrenal insufficiency was hormonally diagnosed in five cases, but ACTH levels were measured in only three cases (high in one case and normal/low in other two cases). Bilateral adrenal non- or hemorrhagic infarction was identified in five reports (two had adrenal insufficiency, two had normal cortisol levels and one case had no data). Interestingly, the only case with well-characterized new-onset acute primary adrenal insufficiency after COVID-19 had a previous diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. In our case, antiphospholipid syndrome diagnosis was established only after the adrenal infarction triggered by COVID-19. Our findings support the association between bilateral adrenal infarction and antiphospholipid syndrome triggered by COVID-19.

{"text": "Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are very promising in the treatment of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections experienced by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need of inhalable formulations able to deliver the intact CAMP in conductive airways and to shield its interactions with airway mucus/bacterial biofilm, thus enhancing CAMP/bacteria interactions. Along these lines, the aim of this work was the design and development of nano-embedded microparticles (NEM) for sustained delivery of CAMPs in the lung. To this purpose, nanoparticles (NPs) made of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) containing a model CAMP, colistin (Col), were produced by emulsion/solvent diffusion technique. Engineering NPs with chitosan (CS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) allowed to modulate surface properties and, in so doing, to improve NP transport through artificial CF mucus. In order to achieve a long-term stable dosage form useful for NP inhalation, NPs were spray-dried in different carriers (lactose or mannitol), thus producing NEM. The most promising NEM formulations were selected on the basis of bulk and flow properties, distribution of NPs in the carrier and aerosolization performance upon delivery through a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler. Of note, selected Col-loaded NEM were found to kill P. aeruginosa biofilm and to display a prolonged efficacy in biofilm eradication compared to the free Col. This effect was likely ascribable to the ability of NPs to penetrate into bacterial biofilm, as demonstrated by confocal analysis, and to sustain Col release inside it. Taken all together, our results indicate that adequate engineering of PLGA NPs represents an enticing technological approach to harness novel antimicrobials for P. aeruginosa lung infection, such as CAMPs, especially in CF.

{"text": "When an animal is reminded of a prior experience and shortly afterward treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor, the consolidated memory for the experience can be disrupted; by contrast, protein synthesis inhibition without prior reminding commonly does not disrupt long-term memory [1-3]. Such results imply that the reminding triggers reconsolidation of the memory. Here, we asked whether the behavioral and synaptic changes associated with the memory for long-term sensitization (LTS) of the siphon-withdrawal reflex in the marine snail Aplysia californica [4, 5] could undergo reconsolidation. In support of this idea, we found that when sensitized animals were given abbreviated reminder sensitization training 48-96 hr after the original sensitization training, followed by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, LTS was disrupted. We also found that long-term (\u2265 24 hr) facilitation (LTF) [6], which can be induced in the monosynaptic connection between Aplysia sensory and motor neurons in dissociated cell culture by multiple spaced pulses of the endogenous facilitatory transmitter serotonin (5-HT) [7, 8], could be eliminated by treating the synapses with one reminder pulse of 5-HT, followed by anisomycin, at 48 hr after the original training.

Variants in noncoding regions have been increasingly suggested to contribute to the missing heritability. In this study, we investigated whether variation in craniofacial enhancers contributes to NSCLP. Candidate enhancers were identified using VISTA Enhancer Browser and previous publications. Prioritization was based on patterning defects in knockout mice, deletion/duplication of craniofacial genes in animal models and results of whole exome/whole genome sequencing studies. This resulted in 20 craniofacial enhancers to be investigated. Custom amplicon-based sequencing probes were designed and used for sequencing 380 NSCLP probands (from multiplex and simplex families of non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Hispanic ethnicities) using Illumina MiSeq. The frequencies of identified variants were compared to ethnically matched European (CEU) and Los Angeles Mexican (MXL) control genomes and used for association analyses.

For fludioxonil, the fungus exhibited differential sensitivities (i.e., approximately 14% of isolates were resistant to fludioxonil and the resistance was stable). Fludioxonil-resistant isolates had a mean EC50 value of 2.2380 \u00b5g/ml, whereas the mean EC50 value was 0.0194 \u00b5g/ml in fludioxonil-sensitive isolates. The mean EC50 values of C. nymphaeae for pyraclostrobin and prochloraz were 0.0083 \u00b5g/ml and 0.002 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. No cross-resistance was observed between fungicides from different groups. Mycelial growth rate, control efficacy, and osmotic stress responses were significantly different (P < 0.05) between fludioxonil-sensitive (FluS) and -resistant (FluR) isolates, but no significant difference was observed (P > 0.05) in virulence and sporulation between FluS and FluR isolates.

To prove its predictivity, we exposed zebrafish embryos from 0 to 96\u2009h post fertilization to a battery of 31 compounds classified as teratogens or non-teratogens in mammals. The teratogenicity score was based on the measurement of 16 phenotypical parameters, namely heart edema, pigmentation, body length, eye size, yolk size, yolk sac edema, otic vesicle defects, otoliths defects, body axis defects, developmental delay, tail bending, scoliosis, lateral fins absence, hatching ratio, lower jaw malformations and tissue necrosis. Among the 31 compounds, 20 were detected as teratogens and 11 as non-teratogens, resulting in 94.44 % sensitivity, 90.91 % specificity and 87.10 % accuracy compared to rodents. These percentages decreased slightly when referred to humans, with 87.50 % sensitivity, 81.82 % specificity and 74.19 % accuracy, but allowed an increase in the prediction levels reported by rodents for the same compounds. Positive compounds showed a high correlation among teratogenic parameters, pointing out at general developmental delay as major cause to explain the physiological/morphological malformations. A more detailed analysis based on deviations from main trends revealed potential specific modes of action for some compounds such as retinoic acid, DEAB, ochratoxin A, haloperidol, warfarin, valproic acid, acetaminophen, dasatinib, imatinib, dexamethasone, 6-aminonicotinamide and bisphenol A.

We have demonstrated the existence of a second stanniocalcin gene in fish, designated fish STC2, with only 30% identity to fish STC1. However, phylogenetic analysis and comparison of the genomic structure of STC genes in vertebrates indicated that STC1 and STC2 genes were probably derived from a common ancestor gene. Based on the prominent expression of mammalian STC1 in the ovary, we tested STC2 expression in rat ovary and the regulation of STC2 expression by gonadotropins. Treatment of immature rats with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin increased STC2 transcripts, whereas subsequent treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin suppressed STC2 expression. Real-time PCR analyses also demonstrated that STC2 is expressed mainly in thecal layers. In situ hybridization studies also revealed that STC2 is expressed in thecal cell layers of antral and preovulatory follicles after gonadotropin stimulation. To elucidate the physiological functions of STC2, recombinant human and fish STC2 proteins were generated and found to be N-glycosylated homodimers. In cultured granulosa cells, treatment with human or fish STC2 suppressed FSH-induced progesterone, but not estradiol or cAMP, production. The STC2 suppression of progesterone production was associated with the inhibition of FSH-induced CYP11A and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression.

Expression of the fish IFNs were studied in head kidney, leukocytes or TO cells after stimulation with the dsRNA poly I:C or the imidazoquinoline S-27609.

In contrast, S-27609 induces mammalian IFN-alpha in plasmacytoid dendritic cells through the TLR7 pathway independent of NF-kappaB. The presence of an NF-kappaB site in their promoters and their strong up-regulation by poly I:C, suggest that salmon IFNa1/IFNa2 are induced through similar pathways as IFN-beta. In contrast, the apparent lack of NF-kappaB motif in the promoter and the strong upregulation by S-27609 in head kidney and leukocytes, suggest that IFNb genes are induced through a pathway similar to mammalian IFN-alpha.

In this study, we have identified a novel deubiquitinating enzyme USP21 which interacts with NANOG by both yeast two hybrid screening for DUBs and immunoprecipitation analyses. These analyses revealed that USP21 specifically regulates the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and stability of NANOG, providing a new way of maintaining the pluripotency of ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).", "meta": {"pmid": 27956178}}
{"text": "Sinomenine, an anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug used in China for decades, is usually co-administered with cardiovascular (CV) drugs to reduce arthritis-related risk of cardiovascular diseases. This study was to investigate whether and how CV drugs affect the pharmacokinetic profile of sinomenine. In rat liver microsomes (RLMs), the key metabolic enzymes of sinomenine were identified by using specific inhibitors. The influences of CV drugs, including propranolol, verapamil, warfarin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin, on the metabolism of sinomenine were examined. Cocktail probe, RT-qPCR, and western blotting were performed to unveil the underlying mechanism of the drug-drug interaction. The key metabolic enzymes of sinomenine were identified to be CYP3A1/2 and CYP2D1 in RLMs. Among the CV drugs screened, simvastatin and lovastatin were shown to inhibit the liver metabolism of sinomenine with Ki values of 13.00 and 25.83\u202f\u03bcM, respectively. Single administration of simvastatin or lovastatin in rats increased the AUC value of sinomenine to 1.40- or 1.50-fold, and decreased the CLz/F value to 68.19% or 65.44%, respectively. In contrast, multiple administrations of simvastatin, but not lovastatin, increased the CLz/F value of sinomenine to 1.38-fold and decreased the AUC value to 71.59%. Further studies showed that the long-term administration of simvastatin could up-regulate the expression of CYP3A1/2 to account for the effect. This study demonstrated the potential effect of simvastatin and lovastatin on the metabolism of sinomenine for the first time. The findings provide guidelines for the co-administration of sinomenine with simvastatin or lovastatin in clinic.", "meta": {"pmid": 30096386}}
{"text": "In this open controlled clinical trial the lipid-lowering effect, the tolerance and clinical safety of the new hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin and cholestyramine were compared in the treatment of 45 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia over a period of 16 weeks. Following a dietary lead-in of six weeks, patients were randomized at a ratio of 3:2 to receive either pravastatin 10 mg b.i.d. or cholestyramine 8 g b.i.d. The dose of pravastatin was increased to 40 mg per day after eight weeks of treatment and after 16 weeks cholestyramine 8 g b.i.d. was added. Two thirds of the patients in the cholestyramine group were switched to gemfibrocil 900 mg. At the end of the 48 week treatment period the mean reduction rates of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides for the pravastatin combination compared to cholestyramine (in brackets values for gemfibrocil) were -30, -35 and -17% versus -17 (-19), -25 (-22) and +27 (-24)%. Pravastatin lead to an increase of the HDL concentration of approximately 8%, gemfibrocil to approximately 13%, whilst cholestyramine alone did not change this lipid fraction. The reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was associated with a decrease in the apolipoprotein B concentration. However, the apolipoprotein AI and AII levels remained unchanged. Due to the absence of clinically relevant side effects and laboratory abnormalities coupled with the excellent compliance in this study, pravastatin proved to be a convincing therapeutic alternative to cholestyramine and gemfibrocil. The combination therapy of pravastatin and cholestyramine offers a potentially highly efficacious and safe therapeutic regimen for the future.", "meta": {"pmid": 1903497}}
{"text": "Calcium oscillations exert physiological control on mitochondrial energy metabolism and can also lead to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cell death. The outcome of the mitochondrial calcium signaling is altered by stress factors such as ceramide or staurosporine. However, the mechanism of this proapoptotic switch remains unclear. Using genetic, biochemical, pharmacological, and functional approaches, we here show that ceramide and staurosporine target PP2A and protein kinases A and C, respectively, in a mitochondria-associated signaling complex to induce dephosphorylation of the BH3-only protein Bad. Dephosphorylated Bad sensitizes the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) to Ca2+ through a Bcl-xL-sensitive and VDAC-mediated process. Furthermore, the Bad-induced sensitization of the PTP to Ca2+ does not require Bax or Bak. Thus, phospho-regulatory mechanisms converge on Bad to switch between the survival and apoptotic functions of mitochondrial calcium signaling by activating a mechanism whereby a BH3-only protein bypasses Bax/Bak and engages the PTP.", "meta": {"pmid": 19217411}}

{"text": "Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are classified into embryonal (ERMS), alveolar (ARMS), and pleomorphic (PRMS) subtypes. ERMS, including botryoid variants, typically occurs in young children, ARMS typically occurs in older children and young adults, and PRMS occurs in older adults. Although ARMSs show thin fibrous bands separating nests of cells, abundant extracellular matrix production is rare in RMS. In the course of reviewing hyalinizing sarcomas we discovered a distinctive RMS in adults that closely mimicked osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma because of the extensive matrix production. Four RMSs with hyalinized matrix were retrieved from our files. These cases were evaluated with respect to patient age and sex, tumor site and size, growth pattern, nuclear grade, cellularity, mitotic figures/20 high power fields, vascular invasion, necrosis, the presence of rhabdomyoblasts, multinucleated cells, and alveolar growth pattern. Immunohistochemistry for desmin, myogenin, MyoD1, actin, cytokeratin, S-100 protein, collagen II, and CD99 was performed. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the ARMS-associated PAX3/FKHR and PAX7/PKHF was also performed on three cases. The cases involved the forearm, hand, orbit, and nasopharynx of a 40-year-old woman, a 50-year-old man, an 18-year-old man, and a 21-year-old man, respectively. The tumors ranged from 3.7 to 8 cm and consisted of lobules and infiltrating cords of small round malignant cells embedded in a densely hyalinized matrix having both a chondroid and osteoid-like appearance. No definite lacunae or matrix calcification was present. An alveolar pattern was only present focally, and tumor giant cells were not present. One case had a single focus of rhabdomyoblastic differentiation with strap cells. Mitotic activity was >20 mitotic figures/20 high power fields in three of four cases. Immunohistochemically, one case strongly expressed desmin, whereas three cases expressed it focally, with a dot-like pattern. Myogenin was only focally positive, but MyoD1 was present in nearly every cell of each case. Two cases expressed actin and one expressed CD99. No case expressed cytokeratin, S-100 protein, or collagen II. Only one case contained adequate RNA for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and this case was negative for the ARMS-associated gene fusions. Follow-up showed one patient to be dead of metastatic disease at 60 months despite intensive therapy, another patient to be disease free at 26 months, and the third patient to be disease free at 5 months. The fourth case is recent. These cases are a distinctive-appearing rhabdomyosarcoma easily mistaken for variants of chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or even sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma because of their hyalinizing appearance compounded by their typically focal and dot-like desmin expression. These four cases are essentially identical to the three unusual RMSs recently reported by Mentzel and Katenkamp as \"sclerosing, pseudovascular rhabdomyosarcoma in adults.\" Although the focal alveolar architecture and the primitive cytologic appearance of these hyalinizing RMS suggest a relationship with ARMS, the presence of abundant strap cells in one case, the predominant expression of MyoD1 rather than myogenin, and the absence of ARMS-associated fusions genes point more strongly toward a variant of ERMS. However, the late adult age in two cases is unusual for both EMRS and ARMS, suggesting that sclerosing RMS may prove to be a distinct subtype of RMS. Study of additional cases will be necessary to more fully elucidate its place among RMS and its prognostic significance.", "meta": {"pmid": 12218574}}

{"text": "ohr (organic hydroperoxide resistance gene) is present in several species of bacteria, and its deletion renders cells specifically sensitive to organic peroxides. The goal of this work was to determine the biochemical function of Ohr from Xylella fastidiosa. All of the Ohr homologues possess two cysteine residues, one of them located in a VCP motif, which is also present in all of the proteins from the peroxiredoxin family. Therefore, we have investigated whether Ohr possesses thiol-dependent peroxidase activity. The ohr gene from X. fastidiosa was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant Ohr decomposed hydroperoxides in a dithiothreitol-dependent manner. Ohr was about twenty times more efficient to remove organic hydroperoxides than to remove H(2)O(2). This result is consistent with the organic hydroperoxide sensitivity of Delta ohr strains. The dependence of Ohr on thiol compounds was ascertained by glutamine synthetase protection assays. Approximately two thiol equivalents were consumed per peroxide removed indicating that Ohr catalyzes the following reaction: 2RSH + ROOH --> RSSR + ROH + H(2)O. Pretreatment of Ohr with N-ethyl maleimide and substitution of cysteine residues by serines inhibited this peroxidase activity indicating that both of the Ohr cysteines are important to the decomposition of peroxides. C125S still had a residual enzymatic activity indicating that Cys-61 is directly involved in peroxide removal. Monothiol compounds do not support the peroxidase activity of Ohr as well as thioredoxin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and from Spirulina. Interestingly, dithiothreitol and dyhydrolipoic acid, which possess two sulfhydryl groups, do support the peroxidase activity of Ohr.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidative stress and accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) induce neuroinflammation, which augments pSer-IRS-1 and reduces pTyr-IRS-1 disturbing insulin signaling pathway. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and biotin possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and, in this study, their impact on insulin signaling is investigated in an aluminium chloride (AlCl3 ) model of AD. AD was induced by oral administration of AlCl3 (75\u2009mg/kg) for 60 days. Biotin (2\u2009mg/kg), CoQ10 (10\u2009mg/kg), and their combination were supplemented concomitantly with AlCl3 for 60 days. Memory test and histological examination were performed. Brain levels of lipid peroxides, antioxidants (reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase), inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-1, and nuclear factor \u03baB), and phosphorylated Akt (survival kinase) as well as protein levels of A\u03b2, IRS-1 (pTyr and pSer), and caspase-3 (apoptotic marker) were determined.

In this study, the effects of combined Bfr and low-intensity ES on diabetes-associated muscle atrophy were investigated by evaluating advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) in rats. Twenty-four Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were randomly divided into four treatment groups: sedentary DM, DM\u2009+\u2009Bfr (pressure cuffs placed around the thigh), DM\u2009+\u2009ES, and DM\u2009+\u2009Bfr\u2009+\u2009ES. Six Wistar rats were used as an age-matched control. Levels of AGEs and the expression of RAGE, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were determined in plantaris muscles. Diabetes resulted in a loss of muscle mass and upregulation of AGEs and RAGE in the plantaris muscle compared with the control group. Treatment with Bfr and ES alone failed to attenuate diabetes-associated loss of muscle mass, and could not prevent the upregulation of AGEs. However, the combination of Bfr and ES prevented the diabetes-associated decrease in muscle mass and upregulation of AGEs. In addition, the combination treatment prevented diabetes-associated decreases in the expression of phosphorylated rpS6.

{"text": "ODC (ornithine decarboxylase)-dependent putrescine synthesis promotes the successive clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by macrophages, contributing to inflammation resolution. However, it remains unknown whether ODC is required for other arms of the resolution program. Approach and Results: RNA sequencing of ODC-deficient macrophages exposed to ACs showed increases in mRNAs associated with heightened inflammation and decreases in mRNAs related to resolution and repair compared with WT (wild type) macrophages. In zymosan peritonitis, myeloid ODC deletion led to delayed clearance of neutrophils and a decrease in the proresolving cytokine, IL (interleukin)-10. Nanoparticle-mediated silencing of macrophage ODC in a model of atherosclerosis regression lowered IL-10 expression, decreased efferocytosis, enhanced necrotic core area, and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Mechanistically, ODC deletion lowered basal expression of MerTK (MER tyrosine-protein kinase)-an AC receptor-via a histone methylation-dependent transcriptional mechanism. Owing to lower basal MerTK, subsequent exposure to ACs resulted in lower MerTK-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2-dependent IL-10 production. Putrescine treatment of ODC-deficient macrophages restored the expression of both MerTK and AC-induced IL-10. These findings demonstrate that ODC-dependent putrescine synthesis in macrophages maintains a basal level of MerTK expression needed to optimally resolve inflammation upon subsequent AC exposure.

At the macroscopic level, scaly skin lesions induced by daily applications of imiquimod in wild-type mice were almost totally absent in IL-22-deficient mice or in mice treated with a blocking anti-IL-22 Ab. At the microscopic level, IL-22-deficient mice showed a dramatic decrease in the development of pustules and a partial decrease in acanthosis. At the molecular level, the absence or inhibition of IL-22 strongly decreased the expression of chemotactic factors such as CCL3 and CXCL3 and of biomarkers such as S100A8, S100A7, and keratin 14, which reflect the antimicrobial and hyperproliferative responses of keratinocytes.

We demonstrate that the selective activation of a subset of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) cistrome in MCF7 breast cancer cells provides specificity to the estradiol (E2) response. ERalpha-specific enhancers that are subject to E2-induced coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) action are critical to E2-stimulated gene expression. This is true for both FoxA1-dependent and independent enhancers. In contrast, a subset of E2-suppressed genes are controlled by FoxA1-independent ERalpha binding sites. Nonetheless, these are sites of E2-induced CARM1 activity. In addition, the MCF7 RNA polymerase II cistrome reveals preferential occupancy of E2-regulated promoters prior to stimulation. Interestingly, E2-suppressed genes tend to lie in otherwise silent genomic regions. Together, our results suggest that the transcriptional response to E2 in breast cancer cells is dependent on the interplay between polymerase II pre-occupied promoters and the subset of the ERalpha cistrome associated with coactivation.", "meta": {"pmid": 19364822}}

The isolated H. pylori strain was metronidazole susceptible in 93%. Antral biopsy samples were taken for culture, urease testing, histology and, in most patients, for PCR at least 6 wk after treatment. A separate corpus sample was taken for culture. Eradication was defined as the absence of H. pylori in all specimens. In seven cases, when only histology was doubtfully positive, and all other tests including PCR were negative, a 13C-urea breath test was performed, the result of which was recorded by the patient on a semi-quantitative scale. H. pylori was eradicated by triple therapy in 96.3% and by amoxicillin/omeprazole in 77.2% of the patients (p = 0.008). Side effects occurred more often with triple therapy (72.7% vs. 50.8%; p< 0.05) but were mild in most cases. Severe side effects occurred equally in both treatment groups. When the prevalence of metronidazole resistance is low, triple therapy is more effective than amoxicillin/omeprazole.

{"text": "Genetic alterations that might lead to colorectal cancer involve essential genes including those involved in DNA repair, inclusive of base excision repair (BER). Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is one of the most well characterized BER genes that catalyzes the removal of thymine moieties from G/T mismatches and is also involved in many cellular functions, such as the regulation of gene expression, transcriptional coactivation, and the control of epigenetic DNA modification. Mutation of the TDG gene is implicated in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between TDG gene polymorphisms and their involvement in colon cancer susceptibility. One hundred blood samples were obtained from colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls for the genotyping of seven SNPs in the TDG gene. DNA was extracted from the blood, and the polymorphic sites (SNPs) rs4135113, rs4135050, rs4135066, rs3751209, rs1866074, and rs1882018 were investigated using TaqMan genotyping. One of the six TDG SNPs was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. The AA genotype of the TDG SNP rs4135113 increased the risk of colon cancer development by more than 3.6-fold, whereas the minor allele A increased the risk by 1.6-fold. It also showed a 5-fold higher risk in patients over the age of 57. SNP rs1866074 showed a significant protective association in CRC patients. The GA genotype of TDG rs3751209 was associated with a decreased risk in males.

{"text": "Patients with diabetes mellitus are at higher risk for cardiovascular events than those without diabetes. Furthermore, patients with diabetes have a characteristic 'lipid triad' of low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, high triglyceride levels, and normal or slightly raised low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, with a preponderance of small, dense LDL-C particles. Current guidelines on preventing cardiovascular disease recognize the need not only to reduce LDL-C levels, but also to increase HDL-C and decrease triglyceride levels in diabetic patients. Some clinical trials of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have included large populations of diabetic patients. In some of these trials (such as 4S [Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study], CARE [Cholesterol and Recurrent Events] trial, and the HPS [Heart Protection Study]), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment significantly reduced cardiovascular events in diabetic patients, whereas in other trials (ALLHAT-LLT [Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial], ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial]) the reductions were not significant. In CARDS (Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study), the first large HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor study to enroll only patients with type 2 diabetes, atorvastatin reduced cardiovascular events by 37% (p=0.001) compared with placebo. Fibric acid derivatives (fibrates), which are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated alpha receptors, exert their effects by altering the transcription of genes encoding proteins that control lipoprotein metabolism. Fibric acid derivatives are a valuable tool in the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes, as they reduce plasma triglyceride levels by 30--50%, increase HDL-C levels by 10--15%, and shift the distribution of LDL subfractions towards larger, less atherogenic particles. The DAIS (Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study), which was conducted exclusively in patients with type 2 diabetes, found that fenofibrate reduces the progression of angiographic coronary artery disease. The VA-HIT (Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program HDL-C Intervention Trial) showed that gemfibrozil reduced cardiovascular events in subgroups of diabetic patients. A large clinical event study, FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes), which is currently being completed, will provide further information on the value of fenofibrate for the reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes.", "meta": {"pmid": 16185099}}

Their activity is tightly controlled by inhibitors including members of the serine protease Kazal-type (SPINK) family. These enzymes are promising targets for the treatment of skin desquamation, inflammation and cancer. Spink3 or caltrin I is expressed in mouse pancreas and males accessory glands and the resulting mature protein has been associated with different activities such as an inhibitor of trypsin and acrosin activity, calcium transport inhibitor in sperm and inhibitor of cell proliferation during embryogenesis. In this study, we produced a soluble recombinant Spink3 from mouse seminal vesicle (rmSpink3) that inhibited the activity of human KLKs. Using FRET substrates, rmSpink3 exhibited a potent inhibitory activity against human KLK2, KLK3, KLK5 (Ki ranging from 260 to 1500 nM), and to a lesser extent against KLK6, KLK1 and KLK7 (Ki around 3000 nM). As shown by mass spectrometry analysis of rmSpink3 incubated with trypsin, the inhibitor was not truncated by the target enzyme. Based on the in silico analysis of the expression of Spink3/SPINK1 and KLKs it is speculated that some KLKs may be natural targets of Spink3/SPINK1, however experimental confirmation using both proteins from mouse or human origin is needed.

{"text": "The homologous membrane proteins Rom-1 and peripherin-2 are localized to the disk rims of photoreceptor outer segments (OSs), where they associate as tetramers and larger oligomers. Disk rims are thought to be critical for disk morphogenesis, OS renewal and the maintenance of OS structure, but the molecules which regulate these processes are unknown. Although peripherin-2 is known to be required for OS formation (because Prph2-/- mice do not form OSs; ref. 6), and mutations in RDS (the human homologue of Prph2) cause retinal degeneration, the relationship of Rom-1 to these processes is uncertain. Here we show that Rom1-/- mice form OSs in which peripherin-2 homotetramers are localized to the disk rims, indicating that peripherin-2 alone is sufficient for both disk and OS morphogenesis. The disks produced in Rom1-/- mice were large, rod OSs were highly disorganized (a phenotype which largely normalized with age) and rod photoreceptors died slowly by apoptosis. Furthermore, the maximal photoresponse of Rom1-/- rod photoreceptors was lower than that of controls. We conclude that Rom-1 is required for the regulation of disk morphogenesis and the viability of mammalian rod photoreceptors, and that mutations in human ROM1 may cause recessive photoreceptor degeneration.", "meta": {"pmid": 10802659}}

{"text": "The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) were studied on the monosynaptic reflex (MSR) and the polysynaptic reflex (PSR) in acute and chronic spinal rats. Radioimmunoassay showed that while chronic spinal transection (for 2 weeks) caused the complete depletion of TRH in the ventral lumbar enlargement a certain level of TRH was maintained in the dorsal lumbar enlargement. This result suggested the existence of TRH-containing neurons in the dorsal horn other than the medullary raphe neurons descending to the spinal cord. The latency to the start of the MSR was shortened in chronic spinal rats and the amplitudes of the MSR and PSR were significantly greater than those in acute spinal rats. There was no obvious difference in the effects of TRH and 5-MeODMT on spinal reflexes of acute and of chronic spinal rats although marked supersensitivity to 5-HTP was observed in both the MSR and the PSR in chronic spinal rats. The supersensitivity to 5-HTP was considered to be due to a lack of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake into 5-HT-containing nerve terminals rather than to a change in 5-HT receptors. It is suggested that TRH and 5-HT do not show any mutual requirement for each other in their effects on the spinal reflex since co-depletion of TRH and 5-HT did not change the effects of TRH and 5-MeODMT in chronic spinal rats. The coexistence of 5-HT and TRH in the descending spinal pathway is not considered to be significant for the control of spinal reflexes at the postsynaptic level.", "meta": {"pmid": 3137080}}

The objectives were to correlate physical characterization data using rheologic studies and to compare with clinical assessment of performance in an emergency department (ED). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels, cross-linked using tetrahydroxyborate (THB), were characterized using texture profile analysis. Formulation samples were applied to acute lacerations presented to the ED and factors, such as in vivo residency time and cohesive removal, were assessed. Viscosity was shown to be related to mechanical characteristics, whereas adhesiveness depended on the THB concentration. Residence in, and clean removal from, lacerations was evaluated on 29 patients. Formulation F3 (10.0% PVA, 2.5% w/w THB) displayed the most appropriate characteristics for clinical use by scoring highest in qualitative assessments. Other formulations exhibited difficulties in application and removal due to excessive adhesiveness. The release of a model local anesthetic drug was proportional to the concentration of drug incorporated, but was not substantially affected by small changes in the formulation constituents.

The objectives were to determine: (1) if DEFB126 on human ejaculated sperm was correlated with sperm motility in fertile and infertile men, (2) that recombinant DEFB126 could induce immature sperm motility in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that the proportion of DEFB126-positive sperm was significantly higher in motile sperm. Furthermore, the proportion of DEFB126-labeled sperm was positively correlated with sperm motility and normal morphology. Additional studies indicated that the proportion of DEFB126-positive spermatozoa in fertile volunteers was significantly higher than in volunteers with varicocele, and in infertile volunteers with semen deficiencies. To determine the role of DEFB126 on sperm motility, the DEFB126 gene was cloned and used to generate recombinant DEFB126 in H9C2 cells (rat embryonic heart myoblast cells). Deletion mutations were created into two regions of the protein, which have been linked to male infertility. Immotile testicular spermatozoa were incubated with cells expressing the different forms of DEFB126. Full-length DEFB126 significantly increased motility of co-cultured spermatozoa.

Phosphorylation of the thiazide-sensitive sodium/chloride cotransporter NCC and its upstream activating kinase Ste20/SPS1-related proline/alanine rich kinase (SPAK), as well as the abundance of with no lysine kinase 4 (WNK4), were significantly reduced in the kidneys of NHA2 knock-out mice.

More specifically, loss of NHA2 selectively attenuated KLHL3 phosphorylation and blunted protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-mediated decrease of WNK4 degradation.

{"text": "Many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs, such as EGFR, MET) are negatively regulated by ubiquitination and degradation mediated by Cbl proteins, a family of RING finger (RF) ubiquitin ligases (E3s). Loss of Cbl protein function is associated with malignant transformation driven by increased RTK activity. RF E3s, such as the Cbl proteins, interact with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to confer specificity to the ubiquitination process and direct the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to one or more lysines on the target proteins. Using in vitro E3 assays and yeast two-hybrid screens, we found that Ube2d, Ube2e families, Ube2n/2v1, and Ube2w catalyze autoubiquitination of the Cbl protein and Ube2d2, Ube2e1, and Ube 2n/2v1 catalyze Cbl-mediated substrate ubiquitination of the EGFR and SYK. Phosphorylation of the Cbl protein by by Src resulted in increased E3 activity compared to unphosphorylated cbl or Cbl containing a phosphomimetic Y371E mutation. Ubiquitin chain formation depended on the E2 tested with Cbl with Ube2d2 forming both K48 and K63 linked chains, Ube2n/2v1 forming only K63 linked chains, and Ube2w inducing monoubiquitination.

To further characterize the regulation of ER\u03b1-mediated transcription by CARM1, we screened CARM1-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid. Here, we have identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, DAZ (deleted in azoospermia)-interacting protein 3 (DZIP3), as a novel CARM1-binding protein. DZIP3-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2A has been associated with repression of transcription. However, ER\u03b1 reporter gene assays demonstrated that DZIP3 enhanced ER\u03b1-mediated transcription and cooperated synergistically with CARM1. Interaction with CARM1 was observed with the E3 ligase RING domain of DZIP3. The methyltransferase activity of CARM1 partially contributed to the synergy with DZIP3 for transcription activation, but the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of DZIP3 was dispensable. DZIP3 also interacted with the C-terminal activation domain 2 of glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) and enhanced the interaction between GRIP1 and CARM1. Depletion of DZIP3 by small interfering RNA in MCF7 cells reduced estradiol-induced gene expression of ER\u03b1 target genes, GREB1 and pS2, and DZIP3 was recruited to the estrogen response elements of the same ER\u03b1 target genes.

Purpose To predict CVR images generated from acetazolamide vasodilation with a deep learning network by using only images before acetazolamide administration. Materials and Methods Simultaneous oxygen 15 (15O)-labeled water PET/MRI before and after acetazolamide injection were retrospectively analyzed for patients with Moyamoya disease and healthy control participants from April 2017 to May 2019. Inputs to deep learning models were perfusion-based images (arterial spin labeling [ASL]), structural scans (T2 fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery, T1), and brain location. Two models, that is, 15O-labeled water PET cerebral blood flow (CBF) and MRI (PET-plus-MRI model) before acetazolamide administration and only MRI (MRI-only model) before acetazolamide administration, were trained and tested with sixfold cross-validation. The models learned to predict a voxelwise relative CBF change (r\u0394CBF) map by using r\u0394CBF measured with PET due to acetazolamide as ground truth. Quantitative analysis included image quality metrics (peak signal-to-noise ratio, root mean square error, and structural similarity index), as well as comparison between the various methods by using correlation and Bland-Altman analyses. Identification of vascular territories with impaired r\u0394CBF was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic metrics. Results Thirty-six participants were included: 24 patients with Moyamoya disease (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 41 years \u00b1 12; 17 women) and 12 age-matched healthy control participants (mean age, 39 years \u00b1 16; nine women). The r\u0394CBF maps predicted by both deep learning models demonstrated better image quality metrics than did ASL (all P < .001 in patients) and higher correlation coefficient with PET than with ASL (PET-plus-MRI model, 0.704; MRI-only model, 0.690 vs ASL, 0.432; both P < .001 in patients). Both models also achieved high diagnostic performance in identifying territories with impaired r\u0394CBF (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.95 for PET-plus-MRI model [95% confidence interval: 0.90, 0.99] and 0.95 for MRI-only model [95% confidence interval: 0.91, 0.98]). Conclusion By using only images before acetazolamide administration, PET-plus-MRI and MRI-only deep learning models predicted cerebrovascular reserve images without the need for vasodilator injection. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "meta": {"pmid": 32662761}}
{"text": "Lipoxygenase (ALOX) enzymes are implicated in both pro- and anti-atherogenic processes. The aim of this study was to investigate mRNA expression of 12- and 15-lipoxygenases (ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15, ALOX15B) and the atypical ALOXE3 in human carotid atherosclerotic lesions, in relation to cerebrovascular symptoms and risk factors. The Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies (BiKE) collection of human carotid plaque tissue and associated clinical data was utilized (n=132). Lesion mRNA levels were analyzed by TaqMan qPCR (n=132) and microarray hybridization (n=77). Of the investigated mRNAs, only ALOX15B (15-LOX-2; epidermis-type 15-LOX) was readily detected in all plaque samples by qPCR, and thus suitable for quantitative statistical evaluation. ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15 and ALOXE3 were detected with lower frequency and at lower levels, or virtually undetected. Microarray analysis confirmed ALOX15B as the most abundant 12- or 15-lipoxygenase mRNA in carotid lesions. Comparing plaques with or without attributable cerebrovascular symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke), ALOX15B mRNA levels were higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic plaques (1.31 [1.11-1.56], n=102; and 0.79 [0.55-1.15], n=30, respectively; p=0.008; mean [95% CI], arbitrary units). Multiple regression analysis confirmed symptomatic/asymptomatic status as a significant determinant of ALOX15B mRNA levels, independently of potentially confounding factors. Immunohistochemical analyses showed abundant ALOX15B expression in macrophage-rich areas of carotid lesions, and lipidomic analyses demonstrated the presence of typical ALOX15B products in plaque tissue. In summary, we observed associations between high ALOX15B expression in carotid lesions and a history of cerebrovascular symptoms. These findings suggest a link between ALOX15B and atherothrombotic events that merits further investigation.", "meta": {"pmid": 21316676}}

The prevalence of POAG is the highest among those of African descent, followed by Asians, and the lowest in Europeans. POAG is a genetically complex trait with a substantial fraction exhibiting a significant heritability. Less than 10% of POAG cases in the general population are caused by specific gene mutations and the remaining cases are polygenic. Quantitative traits related to POAG pathogenesis such as intra-ocular pressure (IOP), vertical cup/disc ratio (VCDR), optic disc area, and central corneal thickness (CCT) are highly heritable, and likely to be influenced at least in part by genes and show substantial variation in human populations. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different loci including CAV1/CAV2, TMCO1, CDKN2B-AS1, CDC7-TGFBR3, SIX1/SIX6, GAS7 and ATOH7 to be associated with POAG and its related quantitative traits (endophenotypes).

{"text": "The Notch signaling pathway governs the specification of different cell types in flies, nematodes and vertebrates alike. Principal components of the pathway that activate Notch target genes are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Despite the impact on development and disease, repression mechanisms are less well studied. Repressors are known from arthropods and vertebrates that differ strikingly by mode of action: whereas Drosophila Hairless assembles repressor\u00a0complexes with CSL transcription factors, competition between activator and repressors occurs in vertebrates (for example SHARP/MINT and KyoT2). This divergence raises questions on the evolution: Are there common ancestors throughout the animal kingdom? Available genome databases representing all animal clades were searched for homologues of Hairless, SHARP and KyoT2. The most distant species with convincing Hairless orthologs belong to Myriapoda, indicating its emergence after the Mandibulata-Chelicarata radiation about 500 million years ago. SHARP shares motifs with SPEN and SPENITO proteins, present throughout the animal kingdom. The CSL interacting domain of SHARP, however, is specific to vertebrates separated by roughly 600 million years of evolution. KyoT2 bears a C-terminal CSL interaction domain (CID), present only in placental mammals but highly diverged already in marsupials, suggesting introduction roughly 100 million years ago. Based on the LIM-domains that characterize KyoT2, homologues can be found in Drosophila melanogaster (Limpet) and Hydra vulgaris (Prickle 3 like). These lack the CID of KyoT2, however, contain a PET and additional LIM domains. Conservation of intron/exon boundaries underscores the phylogenetic relationship between KyoT2, Limpet and Prickle. Most strikingly, Limpet and Prickle proteins carry a tetra-peptide motif resembling that of several CSL interactors. Overall, KyoT2 may have evolved from prickle and Limpet to a Notch repressor in mammals. Notch repressors appear to be specific to either chordates or arthropods. Orthologues of experimentally validated repressors were not found outside the phylogenetic group they have been originally identified. However, the data provide a hypothesis on the evolution of mammalian KyoT2 from Prickle like ancestors. The finding of a potential CSL interacting domain in Prickle homologues points to a novel, very ancestral CSL interactor present in the entire animal kingdom.", "meta": {"pmid": 30679936}}

The sepsis rat models and RLE-6TN cellular sepsis-induced pneumonia models were established using ligation and puncture (CLP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of UCA1, EZH2 and HOXA1 in rat lung tissues and RLE-6TN cells was detected. Then, the CLP rats were respectively treated with UCA1 up-regulation or UCA1 silencing, EZH2 overexpression to measure their roles in the pathology, apoptosis, inflammation and NF-\u03baB mRNA and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p-65 levels in CLP rat lung tissues. The cells were subjected to same treatment to examine the effects of UCA1, EZH2 and HOXA1 on viability, apoptosis, inflammation and NF-\u03baB mRNA and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p-65 levels in LPS-induced RLE-6TN cells. The interactions among UCA1, EZH2 and HOXA1 were identified. UCA1 and EZH2 were upregulated while HOXA1 was downregulated in CLP rat lung tissues and LPS-induced RLE-6TN cells. Elevated UCA1 or increased EZH2 aggravated pathology and promoted apoptosis, inflammation and NF-\u03baB mRNA and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p-65 levels in CLP rat lung tissues, and inhibited viability while facilitated apoptosis, inflammation and NF-\u03baB mRNA and phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p-65 levels in LPS-induced RLE-6TN cells. UCA1 inhibition exerted contrary effects. Silenced EZH2 reversed the effects of UCA1 elevation on sepsis-induced pneumonia. UCA1 targeted EZH2 that interacted with HOXA1.

These variants were within or near the genes ABCA1, ANGPTL3, APOA5, APOB, CETP, GALNT2, GCKR, LCAT, LIPC, LPL (2), MMAB-MVK, TRIB1, and XKR6-AMAC1L2. We performed a combined analysis of the family-based and case-control studies (n=2298) using the Z method to combine statistics. Ten of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms were nominally significant and 5 were significant after Bonferroni correction (P=2.20 x 10(-3) to 2.6 x 10(-11)) for the number of tests performed (APOA5, CETP, GCKR, and GALNT2). Interestingly, our strongest signal was obtained for triglycerides with the minor allele of rs964184 (P=2.6 x 10(-11)) in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster region that is significantly more common in Mexicans (27%) than in whites (12%). It is important to confirm whether known loci have a consistent effect across ethnic groups. We show replication of 5 Caucasian genome-wide association studies lipid associations in Mexicans. The remaining loci will require a comprehensive investigation to exclude or verify their significance in Mexicans. We also demonstrate that rs964184 has a large effect (odds ratio, 1.74) and is more frequent in the Mexican population, and thus it may contribute to the high predisposition to dyslipidemias in Mexicans.", "meta": {"pmid": 20160193}}
{"text": "Endometriosis is a common benign gynecological disease, characterized by proliferation of functional endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. The present study involves investigation of alterations in the serum proteome of endometriosis patients compared to healthy controls using 2DE and 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI TOF/TOF-MS. Comparison of serum proteome of endometriosis patients and healthy subjects revealed 25 significant differentially expressed proteins. Gene ontology and network analysis, performed using PANTHER, DAVID, WebGestalt and STRING, revealed that the differentially expressed proteins are majorly involved in response to stimulus, immune system, metabolic, localization and cellular processes. For serum diagnostic marker identification, several robust statistical screening procedures were applied to identify the set of the most significant proteins responsible for successful diagnosis of different endometriosis stages. Partial least squares (PLS) based marker selection tool and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to identify the most significant proteins for disease prediction. Western blotting validation in a separate cohort of patients revealed that haptoglobin (HP), Ig kappa chain C region (IGKC), alpha-1B-glycoprotein (A1BG) can be considered effective serum protein markers for the diagnosis of Stage II, III and IV endometriosis. For diagnosis of Stage I, only IGKC and HP seemed promising. Globally, about 12 in 100 women of reproductive age are diagnosed with endometriosis. The pathogenesis of the disease still remains unclear, leading to non-specific therapeutic approaches for disease management. Moreover, there is a delay of 8-12years in correct diagnosis after the initial onset of symptoms leading to a considerable impact on the woman's lifestyle. Also, the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis, laparoscopy, is an invasive procedure. The value of a noninvasive or semi-invasive diagnostic test for endometriosis with easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and saliva is, therefore, rightfully recognized.

Healing rates for duodenal ulcer with CBS are significantly better than with placebo and are similar to results obtained with cimetidine or ranitidine. CBS is significantly better in the treatment of duodenal ulcer resistant to standard doses of H2 antagonists than increased doses of H2 antagonists. Duodenal ulcer relapse at 12 months after initial healing with CBS is significantly less than with H2-antagonist therapy. Ulcer healing with CBS is not influenced by smoking. H. pylori eradication with CBS appears to have little effect in ulcer healing but is of major importance in preventing ulcer relapse. CBS is effective in combination with antibiotics in eradicating H. pylori-associated gastritis. In gastric ulcer disease CBS therapy resulted in significant healing advantages over placebo and was comparable to treatment with cimetidine and sucralfate.

{"text": "Retinal abnormality and visual disturbances occur in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia (TRMA), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the human thiamine transporter-1 (hTHTR-1). Human retinal pigment epithelial cells play a pivotal role in supplying thiamine to the highly metabolically active retina but nothing is known about the mechanism, regulation or biological processes involved in thiamine transport in these cells. To address these issues, we used human-derived retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells to characterize the thiamine uptake process. Thiamine uptake is energy- and temperature-dependent, pH-sensitive, Na+-independent, saturable at both the nanomolar (apparent Km, 30 +/- 5 nM) and the micromolar (apparent Km, 1.72 +/- 0.3 microM) concentration ranges, specific for thiamine and sensitive to sulfhydryl group inhibition. The diuretic amiloride caused a concentration-dependent inhibition in thiamine uptake, whereas the anti-trypanosomal drug, melarsoprol, failed to affect the uptake process. Both hTHTR-1 and hTHTR-2 are expressed in ARPE-19 cells as well as in native human retinal tissue with expression of the former being significantly higher than that of the latter. Uptake of thiamine was adaptively regulated by extracellular substrate level via transcriptionally mediated mechanisms that involve both hTHTR-1 and hTHTR-2; it was also regulated by an intracellular Ca2+-calmodulin-mediated pathway. Confocal imaging of living ARPE-19 cells expressing TRMA-associated hTHTR-1 mutants (D93H, S143F and G172D) showed various expression phenotypes. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a specialized and regulated uptake process for thiamine in a cellular model of human retinal pigment epithelia that involves hTHTR-1 and hTHTR-2. Further, clinically relevant mutations in hTHTR-1 lead to impaired cell surface expression or function of the transporter in retinal epithelial ARPE-19 cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 17463047}}

The authors analyzed data on 226,866 veterans who received a diagnosis of depression in 2003 or 2004, had at least 6 months of follow-up, and had no history of depression from 2000 to 2002. Suicide attempt rates overall as well as before and after initiation of antidepressant therapy were compared for patients who received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), new-generation non-serotonergic-specific (non-SSRI) antidepressants (bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants, or no antidepressant. Age group analyses were also performed. Suicide attempt rates were lower among patients who were treated with antidepressants than among those who were not, with a statistically significant odds ratio for SSRIs and tricyclics. For SSRIs versus no antidepressant, this effect was significant in all adult age groups. Suicide attempt rates were also higher prior to treatment than after the start of treatment, with a significant relative risk for SSRIs and for non-SSRIs. For SSRIs, this effect was seen in all adult age groups and was significant in all but the 18-25 group. These findings suggest that SSRI treatment has a protective effect in all adult age groups.

{"text": "It is increasingly evident that different inflammatory disorders show some overlap in their pathological features, concurrence in families and individuals, and shared genetic factors. This might also be true for coeliac disease, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal system, which shares two linkage regions with inflammatory bowel disease: on chromosome 5q31 (CELIAC2 and IBD5) and 19p13 (CELIAC4 and IBD6). We hypothesised that these regions contain genes that contribute to susceptibility to both disorders. The overlapping 5q31 region contains only five positional candidate genes, whereas the overlapping 19p13 region has 141 genes. As the common disease gene probably plays a role in inflammation, we selected five functional candidate genes from the 19p13 region. We studied these 10 positional and functional candidate genes in our Dutch coeliac disease cohort using 44 haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Two genes from 19p13 showed a small effect on familial clustering: the cytochrome P450 F3 gene CYP4F3 (P(nominal) 0.0375, odds ratio (OR) 1.77) and CYP4F2 (P(nominal) 0.013, OR 1.33). CYP4F3 and CYP4F2 catalyse the inactivation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent mediator of inflammation responsible for recruitment and activation of neutrophils. The genetic association of LTB4-regulating gene variants connects the innate immune response of neutrophil mobilisation with that of the established Th1 adaptive immunity present in coeliac disease patients.

Cholesterol nucleation time of the bile from lithogenic diet group was prolonged when mixed with bile from garlic or onion groups. High molecular weight proteins of bile from garlic and onion groups delayed cholesterol crystal growth in model bile. Low molecular weight (LMW) proteins from the bile of lithogenic diet group promoted cholesterol crystal growth in model bile, while LMW protein fraction isolated from the bile of garlic and onion groups delayed the same. Biliary LMW protein fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography using Con-A and the lectin-bound and unbound fractions were studied for their influence on cholesterol nucleation time in model bile. Major portion of biliary LMW proteins in lithogenic diet group was bound to Con-A, and this protein fraction promoted cholesterol nucleation time and increased cholesterol crystal growth rate, whereas Con-A unbound fraction delayed the onset of cholesterol crystallization. Biliary protein from garlic/onion group delayed the crystallization and interfered with pronucleating activity of Con-A bound protein fraction.

{"text": "Glutamate (Glu) receptors are classified into two major categories in the mammalian central nervous system: inotropic receptors linked to ion channels and metabotropic receptors linked to phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism. Classification of the inotropic Glu receptors is based on the differential sensitivity to excitement by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainic acid (KA). The NMDA-sensitive subclass is supposed to be a receptor ionophore complex consisting of at least four different subcomponents, including an NMDA recognition site, a glycine (Gly) recognition site, a polyamine recognition site and a cation channel. The NMDA site is radiolabeled by both Glu and competitive antagonists, such as (+-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and DL-(E)-2-amino-4-propyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 39653). The Gly domain, which is labeled by both [3H]Gly and [3H]5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, is sensitive to D-serine but insensitive to strychnine, and this domain seems to be absolutely required for an activation of the NMDA channel by agonists. The ionophore domain is identified by radiolabeled non-competitive NMDA antagonists that gain access to the binding sites within the channel only when it is gated by agonists. The opening of an NMDA channel is allosterically potentiated by Gly and several polyamines. In contrast, an activation of the NMDA channel is blocked by both H+ and divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Zn2+. [3H]AMPA binding displays pharmacological profiles of the AMPA-sensitive subclass with a rank order of agonistic potencies of quisqualic acid (QA) greater than or equal to AMPA greater than Glu greater than KA, which is apparently different from that found for the KA-sensitive subclass (domoic acid greater than or equal to KA greater than QA greater than Glu). In contrast, several quinoxaline derivatives competitively antagonize neuronal responses mediated not only by the AMPA receptor but also by the KA receptor. The metabotropic Glu receptors, which stimulate PI metabolism through an activation of the guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, are activated by Glu, QA and trans-1-amino-cyclopentyl-1,3-di-carboxylic acid (ACPD). Responses mediated by the metabotropic receptors are competitively blocked by 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid. Three or four cloned complementary deoxyribonucleic acids (cDNAs) encoding inotropic Glu receptors are isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. Pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of receptor-ion channels encoded by a transfection of these cDNAs are similar to those observed with the AMPA receptor as well as the KA receptor, but not with the NMDA receptor.", "meta": {"pmid": 1723755}}

Furthermore bone status was analysed using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and extended bone turnover serum markers. After 6-12 weeks, BMO dissolved partly or completely in 93%, while a complete recovery was observed in 50% of the individuals.

The condition has a heterogeneous background but genetic factors are demonstrated by the occurrence of familial cases. We identified a mother and daughter with POF both of whom carry an X;autosome translocation [t(X;11)(q24;q13)]. RNA expression studies of genes flanking the X-chromosome breakpoint revealed that both patients have reduced expression levels of the gene Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component-1 (PGRMC1). Mutation screening of 67 females with idiopathic POF identified a third patient with a missense mutation (H165R) located in the cytochrome b5 domain of PGRMC1. PGRMC1 mediates the anti-apoptotic action of progesterone in ovarian cells and it acts as a positive regulator of several cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed reactions. The CYPs are critical for intracellular sterol metabolism, including biosynthesis of steroid hormones. We show that the H165R mutation associated with POF abolishes the binding of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) to PGRMC1. In addition, the missense mutation attenuates PGRMC1's ability to mediate the anti-apoptotic action of progesterone in ovarian cells. These findings suggest that mutant or reduced levels of PGMRC1 may cause POF through impaired activation of the microsomal cytochrome P450 and increased apoptosis of ovarian cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 18782852}}
{"text": "Progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) comprise a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous rare diseases. Over 70% of PME cases can now be molecularly solved. Known PME genes encode a variety of proteins, many involved in lysosomal and endosomal function. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 84 (78 unrelated) unsolved PME-affected individuals, with or without additional family members, to discover novel causes. We identified likely disease-causing variants in 24 out of 78 (31%) unrelated individuals, despite previous genetic analyses. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher for individuals studied as trios or families (14/28) versus singletons (10/50) (OR = 3.9, p value = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). The 24 likely solved cases of PME involved 18 genes. First, we found and functionally validated five heterozygous variants in NUS1 and DHDDS and a homozygous variant in ALG10, with no previous disease associations. All three genes are involved in dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation, a pathway not previously implicated in PME. Second, we independently validate SEMA6B as a dominant PME gene in two unrelated individuals. Third, in five families, we identified variants in established PME genes; three with intronic or copy-number changes (CLN6, GBA, NEU1) and two very rare causes (ASAH1, CERS1). Fourth, we found a group of genes usually associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, but here, remarkably, presenting as PME, with or without prior developmental delay. Our systematic analysis of these cases suggests that the small residuum of unsolved cases will most likely be a collection of very rare, genetically heterogeneous etiologies.", "meta": {"pmid": 33798445}}
{"text": "Mutations in peripherin 2 (PRPH2, also known as Rds), a tetraspanin protein found in photoreceptor outer segments (OSs), cause retinal degeneration ranging from rod-dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP) to cone-dominant macular dystrophy (MD). Understanding why some Prph2 mutants affect rods while others affect cones remains a critical unanswered question. Prph2 is essential for OS structure and function and exhibits a very specific pattern of oligomerization with its homolog Rom1. Non-covalent Prph2/Rom1 homo- and hetero-tetramers assemble into higher-order covalently linked complexes held together by an intermolecular disulfide bond at Prph2-C150/Rom1-C153. Here we disrupt this crucial bond using a C150S-Prph2 knockin mouse line to study the role of Prph2 higher-order complex formation. We find that C150S-Prph2 traffics to the OS, interacts with Rom1 and forms non-covalent tetramers, but alone cannot support normal OS structure and function. However, C150S-Prph2 supports the initiation or elaboration of OS disc structures, and improves rod OS ultrastructure in the presence of wild-type (WT) Prph2 (i.e. Prph2C150S/+ versus Prph2+/-). Prph2C150S/+ animals exhibit haploinsufficiency in rods, but a dominant-negative phenotype in cones, suggesting cones have a different requirement for large Prph2 complexes than rods. Importantly, cone but not rod function can be improved by the addition of one Prph2Y141C allele, a mutation responsible for pattern dystrophy owing to the extra cysteine. Combined these findings show that covalently linked Prph2 complexes are essential for OS formation, but not for Prph2 targeting to the OS, and that cones are especially sensitive to having a broad distribution of Prph2 complex types (i.e. tetramers and large complexes).", "meta": {"pmid": 29961824}}

Mechanics of isolated papillary muscles were examined under isometric conditions at different temperatures, muscle lengths and frequencies of stimulation. No differences were found in the basic characteristics of contraction and relaxation among the hearts of normal, GPA- and GBA-treated rats at low workloads. However, when paired stimulation was applied, the interval at which fusion occurred was significantly longer in C-depleted than in controls. At high workloads, the developed force (DF) in C-depleted decreased in the same way as in controls, but its subsequent recovery took significantly longer and the recovered DF in C-depleted muscles was smaller than in controls.

The intracellular distribution indicates that AQP6 has a function distinct from trans-epithelial water movement. We show by mutational analyses and immunofluorescence that the N-terminus of AQP6 is a determinant for its intracellular localization. Presence or absence at the plasma membrane of AQP6 constructs was confirmed by electrophysiological methods. Addition of a GFP (green fluorescent protein) or a HA (haemagglutinin) epitope tag (GFP-AQP6 or HA-AQP6) to the N-terminus of AQP6, directed AQP6 to the plasma membranes of transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In contrast, addition of a GFP tag to the C-terminus (AQP6-GFP) caused the protein to remain intracellular, similar to untagged wild-type AQP6. Replacement of the N-terminus of AQP6 by that of AQP1 also directed AQP6 to the plasma membranes, whereas the N-terminus of AQP6 retained AQP1 in cytosolic sites. Our results suggest that the N-terminus of AQP6 is critical for trafficking of the protein to the intracellular sites.

MCM is activated by two proteins, Cdc45 and GINS, which constitute the 'CMG' unwindosome complex together with the MCM core. The archaeal DNA replication system is quite similar to that of eukaryotes, but only limited knowledge about the DNA unwinding mechanism is available, from a structural point of view. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an archaeal GAN (GINS-associated nuclease) from Thermococcus kodakaraensis, the homolog of eukaryotic Cdc45, in both the free form and the complex with the C-terminal domain of the cognate Gins51 subunit (Gins51C). This first archaeal GAN structure exhibits a unique, 'hybrid' structure between the bacterial RecJ and the eukaryotic Cdc45. GAN possesses the conserved DHH and DHH1 domains responsible for the exonuclease activity, and an inserted CID (CMG interacting domain)-like domain structurally comparable to that in Cdc45, suggesting its dual roles as an exonuclease in DNA repair and a CMG component in DNA replication.

Genetic variation in PTPN1, a diabetes susceptibility gene, was investigated for a role in diabetic atherosclerosis. The PTPN1 gene encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B, which is ubiquitously expressed and plays a role in the regulation of several signaling pathways. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed in 590 Caucasian participants with type 2 diabetes in the Diabetes Heart Study using B-mode ultrasound measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and computed tomography measurement of carotid calcified plaque (CarCP) and coronary calcified plaque (CorCP). Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTPN1 were genotyped and assessed for association with IMT, CarCP, and CorCP. A total of 12 SNPs within a block of linkage disequilibrium encompassing the coding sequence of PTPN1 were significantly associated with CorCP (P values from <0.0001 to 0.043) and 3 SNPs also within the block approached significance (P values from 0.058 to 0.066). In addition, a nine-SNP haplotype (GACTTCAGO) was also associated with increased CorCP under a dominant model (P = 0.01). No association was detected with IMT or CarCP. The associated SNPs and haplotype are the same as those observed to be associated with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and fasting glucose in previous studies.

The cDNA sequence of AcISG15-2 encodes a 16.9kDa protein and AcISG15-3 encodes a 18.4kDa protein, both of which possess the characteristic structural features of two tandem ubiquitin-like domains and the LRGG motif necessary for conjugation. Furthermore, the AcISG15-3 protein is expressed with a C-terminal extension in common with the human ISG15 protein. Gene expression analysis using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that AcISG15-1, AcISG15-2, and AcISG15-3 transcripts were up-regulated in head kidney after poly I:C stimulation, suggesting that these proteins may be involved in the cod immune response. However, transient expression of myc-tagged AcISG15 proteins revealed differences in their abilities to form conjugates in vitro. We show that AcISG15-2 forms covalent conjugates to a range of cellular protein as a response to poly I:C, recombinant Atlantic salmon IFNa1 (rSasaIFNa1) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), whereas conjugation was absent for AcISG15-1 and AcISG15-3.

{"text": "BATF family transcription factors (BATF, BATF2 and BATF3) form hetero-trimers with JUNB and either IRF4 or IRF8 to regulate cell fate in T cells and dendritic cells in vivo. While each combination of the hetero-trimer has a distinct role, some degree of cross-compensation was observed. The basis for the differential actions of IRF4 and IRF8 with BATF factors and JUNB is still unknown. We propose that the differences in function between these hetero-trimers may be caused by differences in their DNA binding preferences. While all three BATF family transcription factors have similar binding preferences when binding as a hetero-dimer with JUNB, the cooperative binding of IRF4 or IRF8 to the hetero-dimer/DNA complex could change the preferences. We used Spec-seq, which allows for the efficient and accurate determination of relative affinity to a large collection of sequences in parallel, to find differences between cooperative DNA binding of IRF4, IRF8 and BATF family members. We found that without IRF binding, all three hetero-dimer pairs exhibit nearly the same binding preferences to both expected wildtype binding sites TRE (TGA(C/G)TCA) and CRE (TGACGTCA). IRF4 and IRF8 show the very similar DNA binding preferences when binding with any of the three hetero-dimers. No major change of binding preferences was found in the half-sites between different hetero-trimers. IRF proteins bind with substantially lower affinity with either a single nucleotide spacer between IRF and BATF binding site or with an alternative mode of binding in the opposite orientation. In addition, the preference to CRE binding site was reduced with either IRF binding in all BATF-JUNB combinations. The specificities of BATF, BATF2 and BATF3 are all very similar as are their interactions with IRF4 and IRF8. IRF proteins binding adjacent to BATF sites increases affinity substantially compared to sequences with spacings between the sites, indicating cooperative binding through protein-protein interactions. The preference for the type of BATF binding site, TRE or CRE, is also altered when IRF proteins bind.

{"text": "Brain inflammation induced by ischemic stroke is an important cause of secondary brain injury. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling are believed to drive the progression of brain inflammation. Spermatogenesis-associated protein2 (SPATA2) functions as a partner protein that recruits CYLD, a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling, to signaling complexes. However, the role of SPATA2 in the central nervous system remains unclear and whether it is involved in regulating inflammatory responses remains controversial. Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion (tMCAO/R) surgery. The expression and localization of SPATA2 in the brain were investigated. The lentivirus-mediated shRNA was employed to inhibit SPATA2 expression. The inflammatory responses and outcomes of Spata2 knockdown were investigated. SPATA2 was co-localized with CYLD in neurons. SPATA2 expression was reduced in tMCAO/R rats. Spata2 knockdown resulted in increased microglia, increased expression of Tnfa, Il-1\u03b2, and Il-18, decreased Garcia score, and increased infarct volume. Spata2 knockdown resulted in the activation of P38MAPK and NLRP3 inflammasome and the increased activation of NF-\u03baB signaling.

The present study concentrated on the immunization of a dolphin population (7 wild-born and 22 captive-born individuals) with 2 swine vaccines, the European 'Eurovac Ery\u00ae' vaccine and the American 'ER Bac Plus\u00ae' vaccine, and immunological profile results over a 20-yr time period.

{"text": "The encounter of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) with DNA lesions has severe consequences for the cell as this event provides a strong signal for P53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. To counteract prolonged blockage of transcription, the cell removes the RNAPIIo-blocking DNA lesions by transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), a specialized subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Exposure of mice to UVB light or chemicals has elucidated that TC-NER is a critical survival pathway protecting against acute toxic and long-term effects (cancer) of genotoxic exposure. Deficiency in TC-NER is associated with mutations in the CSA and CSB genes giving rise to the rare human disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS). Recent data suggest that CSA and CSB play differential roles in mammalian TC-NER: CSB as a repair coupling factor to attract NER proteins, chromatin remodellers and the CSA- E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to the stalled RNAPIIo. CSA is dispensable for attraction of NER proteins, yet in cooperation with CSB is required to recruit XAB2, the nucleosomal binding protein HMGN1 and TFIIS. The emerging picture of TC-NER is complex: repair of transcription-blocking lesions occurs without displacement of the DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo, and requires at least two essential assembly factors (CSA and CSB), the core NER factors (except for XPC-RAD23B), and TC-NER specific factors. These and yet unidentified proteins will accomplish not only efficient repair of transcription-blocking lesions, but are also likely to contribute to DNA damage signalling events.", "meta": {"pmid": 18166977}}

Bilateral multifocal renal tumours that develop in BHD syndrome are most frequently hybrid oncocytic tumours and chromophobe renal carcinoma, but can present with other histologies. Germline mutations in the FLCN gene on chromosome 17 are responsible for BHD syndrome--BHD-associated renal tumours display inactivation of the wild-type FLCN allele by somatic mutation or chromosomal loss, confirming that FLCN is a tumour suppressor gene that fits the classic two-hit model. FLCN interacts with two novel proteins, FNIP1 and FNIP2, and with AMPK, a negative regulator of mTOR. Studies with FLCN-deficient cell and animal models support a role for FLCN in modulating the AKT-mTOR pathway. Emerging evidence links FLCN with a number of other molecular pathways and cellular processes important for cell homeostasis that are frequently deregulated in cancer, including regulation of TFE3 and/or TFEB transcriptional activity, amino-acid-dependent mTOR activation through Rag GTPases, TGF\u03b2 signalling, PGC1\u03b1-driven mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy.

Most mammals encode at least two endochitinases (CHIT1 and CHIA/AMCase), as well as several homologues encoding catalytically inactive chitinase-like proteins or chilectins (all GH18 family proteins). It is becoming increasingly apparent that chitinases and chilectins play an important role in inflammation and their over-expression is correlated with numerous pathological conditions. We have conducted a detailed phylogenomic study of this gene family in order to understand its evolutionary history and the selection forces at work. The family has undergone extensive expansion, initiating with a duplication event at the root of the vertebrate tree generating the ancestors of CHIT1 and CHIA. Our analyses indicate that two further duplications of ancestral CHIA predate the divergence of bony fishes, one leading to a newly identified paralogous group (we have termed CHIO). In fish these sequences fall into two clades bearing the hallmarks of the teleost-specific genome duplication (referred to as 3R). In tetrapods, additional duplications predate and postdate the amphibian/mammalian split and relics of some exist as pseudogenes in the human genome. Expansion and selection of chilectins is pronounced in mammals and CHI3L1 (with a proposed function in immunity) is found in most mammals but not other vertebrates, while CHI3L2 is also evident in reptiles.

During gestation, the Wolffian duct, which generates male reproductive organs and the kidney, is formed, and the M\u00fcllerian duct then elongates caudally along the preformed Wolffian duct. Anatomical separation of these two ducts in chick embryos demonstrated that the Wolffian duct is required for M\u00fcllerian duct formation. Likewise, a few reports supported this notion in mice, including studies on Wnt9b mutant mice and Wolffian duct-specific Lhx1 deletion. However, anatomical ablation of the Wolffian duct has not been established in mice. In this study, we addressed the importance of the interaction between these two reproductive ducts, by generating mice that specifically expressed a diphtheria toxin subunit in the Wolffian duct. While this genetic ablation of the Wolffian duct resulted in kidney hypoplasia/agenesis in both male and female mutant mice, the female mutant mice lacked the uterus, which is derived from the M\u00fcllerian duct. At mid-gestation, the M\u00fcllerian duct was truncated at the level where the mutant Wolffian duct was prematurely terminated, meaning that M\u00fcllerian duct elongation was dependent on the preformed Wolffian duct. However, Wnt9b expression in the Wolffian duct and the resultant canonical Wnt activity, as well as Lhx1 expression, were not affected in the mutant mice.

{"text": "Innervated skeletal muscles are endowed with K+ channels activatable by K+ channel openers. It is of interest to know whether the denervation-induced depolarization is due to a deficiency of such a K+ channel. In denervated mouse diaphragm, lemakalim, a K+ channel opener, effectively hyperpolarizes membrane and reduces membrane resistance, spontaneous activity as well as twitch force reversibly. Reductions of transmembrane K+ gradient diminish the lemakalim-induced hyperpolarization. In voltage-clamped fiber, lemakalim induces a long-lasting outward current. A current clamp experiment suggests a reversal potential of around -90 mV. On innervated diaphragm, lemakalim hyperpolarizes membrane and increases conductance if the muscle is predepolarized by anodal current. Lemakalim, however, is much less effective in overcoming the depolarization caused by crotamine, which activates Na+ channel. The effects of lemakalim are not attenuated by blockades of membrane Na+, Ca++ and Cl- permeabilities. Glybenclamide and tolbutamide, blockers of ATP-regulated K+ channel, antagonize the effects of lemakalim at low concentrations and produce slight membrane hyperpolarizations in denervated muscle, but marked membrane depolarizations in innervated muscle at higher concentrations. Cs+ depolarizes both innervated and denervated diaphragms and reduces the hyperpolarizing effect of lemakalim. The results suggest that lemakalim hyperpolarizes denervated muscle via glybenclamide sensitive K+ channels.

{"text": "Titin is a giant elastic protein that spans the half-sarcomere from Z-disk to M-band. It acts as a molecular spring and mechanosensor and has been linked to striated muscle disease. The pathways that govern titin-dependent cardiac growth and contribute to disease are diverse and difficult to dissect. To study titin deficiency versus dysfunction, the authors generated and compared striated muscle specific knockouts (KOs) with progressive postnatal loss of the complete titin protein by removing exon 2 (E2-KO) or an M-band truncation that eliminates proper sarcomeric integration, but retains all other functional domains (M-band exon 1/2 [M1/2]-KO). The authors evaluated cardiac function, cardiomyocyte mechanics, and the molecular basis of the phenotype. Skeletal muscle atrophy with reduced strength, severe sarcomere disassembly, and lethality from 2 weeks of age were shared between the models. Cardiac phenotypes differed considerably: loss of titin leads to dilated cardiomyopathy with combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction-the absence of M-band titin to cardiac atrophy and preserved function. The elastic properties of M1/2-KO cardiomyocytes are maintained, while passive stiffness is reduced in the E2-KO. In both KOs, we find an increased stress response and increased expression of proteins linked to titin-based mechanotransduction (CryAB, ANKRD1, muscle LIM protein, FHLs, p42, Camk2d, p62, and Nbr1). Among them, FHL2 and the M-band signaling proteins p62 and Nbr1 are exclusively upregulated in the E2-KO, suggesting a role in the differential pathology of titin truncation versus deficiency of the full-length protein. The differential stress response is consistent with truncated titin contributing to the mechanical properties in M1/2-KOs, while low titin levels in E2-KOs lead to reduced titin-based stiffness and increased strain on the remaining titin molecules. Progressive depletion of titin leads to sarcomere disassembly and atrophy in striated muscle. In the complete knockout, remaining titin molecules experience increased strain, resulting in mechanically induced trophic signaling and eventually dilated cardiomyopathy. The truncated titin in M1/2-KO helps maintain the passive properties and thus reduces mechanically induced signaling. Together, these findings contribute to the molecular understanding of why titin mutations differentially affect cardiac growth and have implications for genotype-phenotype relations that support a personalized medicine approach to the diverse titinopathies.", "meta": {"pmid": 30700140}}

Monocytes were treated with ACM along with BMP-7 and/or its inhibitor, follistatin, for 48 hours. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, LY-294002, was also studied. Our data show that BMP-7 induces polarization of monocytes into M2 macrophages while significantly increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory markers, arginase-1 and IL-10, and significantly (p<0.05) decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory markers iNOS, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1; (p<0.05). Moreover, addition of the PI3K inhibitor, LY-294002, significantly (p<0.05) decreases upregulation of IL-10 and arginase-1, suggesting involvement of the PI3K pathway in M2 macrophage polarization. Next, following BMP-7 treatment, a significant (p<0.05) increase in p-SMAD1/5/8 and p-PI3K expression resulting in downstream activation of p-Akt and p-mTOR was observed. Furthermore, expression of p-PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, was significantly (p<0.05) increased in the ACM group. However, BMP-7 treatment inhibited its expression, suggesting involvement of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BMP-7 polarizes monocytes into M2 macrophages and enhances anti-inflammatory cytokine expression which is mediated by the activated SMAD-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.

{"text": "Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) is a urea cycle enzyme that forms carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, ammonia and ATP. Bi-allelic mutations of the CPS1 gene result in a urea cycle disorder presenting with hyperammonemia, often with reduced citrulline, and without orotic aciduria. CPS1 deficiency is particularly challenging to treat and lack of early recognition typically results in early neonatal death. Therapeutic interventions have limited efficacy and most patients develop long-term neurologic sequelae. Using transgenic techniques, we generated a conditional Cps1 knockout mouse. By loxP/Cre recombinase technology, deletion of the Cps1 locus was achieved in adult transgenic animals using a Cre recombinase-expressing adeno-associated viral vector. Within four weeks from vector injection, all animals developed hyperammonemia without orotic aciduria and died. Minimal CPS1 protein was detectable in livers. To investigate the efficacy of gene therapy for CPS deficiency following knock-down of hepatic endogenous CPS1 expression, we injected these mice with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAd) expressing the large murine CPS1 cDNA under control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. Liver-directed HDAd-mediated gene therapy resulted in survival, normalization of plasma ammonia and glutamine, and 13% of normal Cps1 expression. A gender difference in survival suggests that female mice may require higher hepatic CPS1 expression. We conclude that this conditional murine model recapitulates the clinical and biochemical phenotype detected in human patients with CPS1 deficiency and will be useful to investigate ammonia-mediated neurotoxicity and for the development of cell- and gene-based therapeutic approaches.", "meta": {"pmid": 29801986}}
{"text": "The failure of some CNS neurons to up-regulate growth-associated genes following axotomy may contribute to their failure to regenerate axons. We have studied gene expression in rat corticospinal neurons following either proximal (intracortical) or distal (spinal) axotomy. Corticospinal neurons were retrogradely labelled with cholera toxin subunit B prior to intracortical lesions or concomitantly with spinal lesions. Alternate sections of forebrain were immunoreacted for cholera toxin subunit B or processed for mRNA in situ hybridization for ATF3, c-jun, GAP-43, CAP-23, SCG10, L1, CHL1 or krox-24, each of which has been associated with axotomy or axon regeneration in other neurons. Seven days after intracortical axotomy, ATF3, c-jun, GAP-43, SCG10, L1 and CHL1, but not CAP-23 or krox-24, were up-regulated by layer V pyramidal neurons, including identified corticospinal neurons. The maximum distance between the lesion and the neuronal cell bodies that up-regulated genes varied between 300 and 500 microm. However, distal axotomy failed to elicit changes in gene expression in corticospinal neurons. No change in expression of any molecule was seen in the neocortex 1 or 7 days after corticospinal axotomy in the cervical spinal cord. The expression of GAP-43, CAP-23, L1, CHL1 and SCG10 was confirmed to be unaltered after this type of injury in identified retrogradely labelled corticospinal neurons. Thus, while corticospinal neuronal cell bodies fail to respond to spinal axotomy, these cells behave like regeneration-competent neurons, up-regulating a wide range of growth-associated molecules if axotomized within the cerebral cortex.", "meta": {"pmid": 12925005}}
{"text": "To date there have been few reports of a gender difference in methylation levels of genes. When examining the methylation levels of four autosomal genes (ESR1, MTHFR, CALCA and MGMT) in the white blood cells of a random sample of Singapore Chinese Health Study cohort participants (n = 291), we encountered an unexpected gender differential. Using MethyLight technology, we calculated a gene-specific percentage of methylated reference (PMR) value, which quantified the relative level of gene methylation for each study subject (134 males and 157 females). Two summary methylation indices were constructed by assigning gene-specific rank scores. We then used ANCOVA to compare logarithmically transformed individual PMR values and summary methylation indices by age and gender simultaneously. Adjustment was made for plasma homocysteine. For ESR1, for which a large proportion of subjects were negative for methylation, we also used polytomous regression to compare methylation across age and gender. Increasing age and the male gender independently predicted increasing PMR values for CALCA and MGMT. For the MTHFR gene, male gender was associated with higher PMR values (P = 0.002), while age was not (P = 0.75). Neither age nor gender had any statistically significant influence on the PMR values for ESR1 (P = 0.13 and 0.96, respectively). Our data suggest that gender is at least as strong a predictor of methylation level in the four genes under study as age, with males showing higher PMRs.", "meta": {"pmid": 15928902}}
{"text": "Dysregulation of apoptosis is a prime hallmark of leukemia. Therefore, drugs which restore the sensitivity of leukemic cells to apoptotic stimuli are promising candidates in the treatment of leukemia. Recently, we have demonstrated that sanguinarine (SNG), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, isolated from Sanguinaria canadensis induces ROS-dependent ERK1/2 activation and autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma cells (Pallichankandy et al., 2015; [43]). In this study, we investigated the antileukemic potential of SNG in vitro, and further examined the molecular mechanisms of SNG-induced cell death. In human leukemic cells, SNG activated apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by activation of caspase cascade, DNA fragmentation and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Importantly, we have identified a crucial role for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent ceramide (Cer) generation in the facilitation of SNG-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we have found that SNG inhibits Akt, a key anti-apoptotic protein kinase by dephosphorylating it at Ser(473), leading to the dephosphorylation of its downstream targets, GSK3\u03b2 and mTOR. Interestingly, inhibition of Cer generation, using acid sphingomyelinase inhibitor, significantly reduced the SNG-induced Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis, whereas, activation of Cer generation using inhibitors of acid ceramidase and glucosylceramide synthase enhanced it. Furthermore, using a group of ceramide activated protein phosphatases (CAPPs) inhibitor (calyculin A, Okadaic acid, and phosphatidic acid), the involvement of protein phosphatase 1 form of CAPP in SNG-induced Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis was demonstrated. Altogether, these results underscore a critical role for H2O2-Cer-Akt signaling axis in the antileukemic action of SNG.", "meta": {"pmid": 27154977}}
{"text": "The adaptor proteins STAC1, STAC2, and STAC3 represent a newly identified family of regulators of voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV) trafficking and function. The skeletal muscle isoform STAC3 is essential for excitation-contraction coupling and its mutation causes severe muscle disease. Recently, two distinct molecular domains in STAC3 were identified, necessary for its functional interaction with CaV1.1: the C1 domain, which recruits STAC proteins to the calcium channel complex in skeletal muscle triads, and the SH3-1 domain, involved in excitation-contraction coupling. These interaction sites are conserved in the three STAC proteins. However, the molecular domain in CaV1 channels interacting with the STAC C1 domain and the possible role of this interaction in neuronal CaV1 channels remained unknown. Using CaV1.2/2.1 chimeras expressed in dysgenic (CaV1.1-/-) myotubes, we identified the amino acids 1,641-1,668 in the C terminus of CaV1.2 as necessary for association of STAC proteins. This sequence contains the IQ domain and alanine mutagenesis revealed that the amino acids important for STAC association overlap with those making contacts with the C-lobe of calcium-calmodulin (Ca/CaM) and mediating calcium-dependent inactivation of CaV1.2. Indeed, patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that coexpression of either one of the three STAC proteins with CaV1.2 opposed calcium-dependent inactivation, although to different degrees, and that substitution of the CaV1.2 IQ domain with that of CaV2.1, which does not interact with STAC, abolished this effect. These results suggest that STAC proteins associate with the CaV1.2 C terminus at the IQ domain and thus inhibit calcium-dependent feedback regulation of CaV1.2 currents.", "meta": {"pmid": 29363593}}

Tissue engineering in BMSCs has made great advances in the regeneration of cartilage and bone defects. To uncover the mechanisms of the multipotent differentiation process, the molecular changes in gene expression profiles during chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation need to be evaluated with reliable, accurate, fast and sensitive methods. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a commonly used technology for analyzing gene expression, depending on an appropriate reference gene to normalize the errors. The commonly used reference genes vary, and no ideal and universal reference genes suitable for all conditions exist; therefore validation of the stability of gene expression is required. In the present study, three common statistical algorithms, geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper, were used to identify the expression stability of 12 genes, and the target differentiation markers during the differentiation of BMSCs were evaluated accurately. Our results demonstrated that YWHAZ, PPIA and GAPDH were suitable as reference genes for chondrogenic differentiation, while RPL13a allowed an efficient normalization expression value of interest genes for osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. By contrast, the most unstable reference genes were 18s rRNA, B2M and HPRT1 in all studies, and these should be avoided when investigating the differentiation of BMSCs.

{"text": "Pools of farnesyl diphosphate and other phosphorylated products of the mevalonate pathway are essential to the post-translational processing and physiological function of small G proteins, nuclear lamins, and growth factor receptors. Inhibitors of enzyme activities providing those pools, namely, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase and mevalonic acid-pyrophosphate decarboxylase, and of activities requiring substrates from the pools, the prenyl protein transferases, have potential for development as novel chemotherapeutic agents. Their potentials as suggested by the clinical responses recorded in Phase I and II investigations of inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase (the statins), of mevalonic acid-pyrophosphate decarboxylase (sodium phenylacetate and sodium phenylbutyrate), and of farnesyl protein transferase (R115777, SCH66336, BMS-214662, Tipifarnib, L-778,123, and, prematurely, perillyl alcohol) are dimmed by dose-limiting toxicities. These nondiscriminant growth-suppressive agents induce G1 arrest and initiate apoptosis and differentiation, effects attributed to modulation of cell signaling pathways either by modulating gene expression, suppressing the post-translational processing of signaling proteins and growth factor receptors, or altering diacylglycerol signaling. Diverse isoprenoids and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, modulate cell growth, induce cell cycle arrest, initiate apoptosis, and suppress cellular signaling activities. Perillyl alcohol, the isoprenoid of greatest clinical interest, initially was considered to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase; follow-up studies revealed that perillyl alcohol suppresses the synthesis of small G proteins and HMG CoA reductase. In sterologenic tissues, sterol feedback control, mediated by sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) 1a and 2, exerts the primary regulation on HMG CoA reductase activity at the transcriptional level. Secondary regulation, a nonsterol isoprenoid-mediated fine-tuning of reductase activity, occurs at the levels of reductase translation and degradation. HMG CoA reductase activity in tumors is elevated and resistant to sterol feedback regulation, possibly as a consequence of aberrant SREBP activities. Nonetheless, tumor reductase remains sensitive to isoprenoid-mediated post-transcriptional downregulation. Farnesol, an acyclic sesquiterpene, and farnesyl homologs, gamma-tocotrienol and various farnesyl derivatives, inhibit reductase synthesis and accelerate reductase degradation. Cyclic monoterpenes, d-limonene, menthol and perillyl alcohol and beta-ionone, a carotenoid fragment, lower reductase mass; perillyl alcohol and d-limonene lower reductase mass by modulating translational efficiency. The elevated reductase expression and greater demand for nonsterol products to maintain growth amplify the susceptibility of tumor reductase to isoprenoids, therein rendering tumor cells more responsive than normal cells to isoprenoid-mediated growth suppression. Blends of lovastatin, a potent nondiscriminant inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, and gamma-tocotrienol, a potent isoprenoid shown to post-transcription-ally attenuate reductase activity with specificity for tumors, synergistically affect the growth of human DU145 and LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells and pending extensive preclinical evaluation, potentially offer a novel chemotherapeutic strategy free of the dose-limiting toxicity associated with high-dose lovastatin and other nondiscriminant mevalonate pathway inhibitors.", "meta": {"pmid": 15229351}}
{"text": "The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are essential for skin and hair function. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins act downstream of these GTPases, controlling actin assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization, but their role in epithelial cells has not been characterized in vivo. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to assess the role of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), the ubiquitously expressed Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like (WASL) protein, in mouse skin. We found that N-WASP deficiency in mouse skin led to severe alopecia, epidermal hyperproliferation, and ulceration, without obvious effects on epidermal differentiation and wound healing. Further analysis revealed that the observed alopecia was likely the result of a progressive and ultimately nearly complete block in hair follicle (HF) cycling by 5 months of age. N-WASP deficiency also led to abnormal proliferation of skin progenitor cells, resulting in their depletion over time. Furthermore, N-WASP deficiency in vitro and in vivo correlated with decreased GSK-3beta phosphorylation, decreased nuclear localization of beta-catenin in follicular keratinocytes, and decreased Wnt-dependent transcription. Our results indicate a critical role for N-WASP in skin function and HF cycling and identify a link between N-WASP and Wnt signaling. We therefore propose that N-WASP acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin-dependent transcription, modulating differentiation of HF progenitor cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 20071778}}
{"text": "Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is modulated by the action of enzymes alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretases, with the latter two mediating the amyloidogenic production of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Cellular modulators of APP processing are well known from studies of genetic mutations (such as those found in APP and presenilins) or polymorphisms (such as the apolipoprotein E4 epsilon-allele) that predisposes an individual to early or late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, several classes of molecule with modulating functions in APP processing and Abeta secretion have emerged. These include the neuronal Munc-18 interacting proteins (Mints)/X11s, members of the reticulon family (RTN-3 and RTN-4/Nogo-B), the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR), the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 and the Rho family GTPases and their effectors. Mints and NgR bind to APP directly, while RTN3 and Nogo-B interact with the beta-secretase BACE1. Phosphorylated APP is a Pin1 substrate, which binds to its phosphor-Thr668-Pro motif. These interactions by and large resulted in a reduction of Abeta generation both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Rho and Rho-kinase (ROCK) activity may underlie the ability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins to reduce Abeta production, a feat which could also be achieved by Rac1 inhibition. Detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of these novel modulators of APP processing, as well as insights into the molecular neurological basis of how Abeta impairs leaning and memory, will open up multiple avenues for the therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's disease.", "meta": {"pmid": 17241154}}

High-throughput sequencing methods reveal characteristic mutation spectra in leukemia associated with different chromosomal disorders. However, the role of mutation events in malignant cell transformation processes remains obscure. We searched for driver mutation events in leukemic cells containing the chimeric CBFB-MYH11 gene, which results from inversion of chromosome 16. Using target enrichment, the coding regions of 84 genes in genomes of 12 children with acute myeloid leukemia with inv(16) were investigated. Somatic mutations have been found in the genes of the proteins of intracellular signaling cascades mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as KIT (41%), NRAS (25%), KRAS (17%), and FLT3 (8.3%).

ESFT are dependent on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) for growth and survival and recent evidence suggests that mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells constitute a candidate ESFT origin. To address the functional relatedness between ESFT-associated fusion proteins, we compared mouse progenitor cell (MPC) permissiveness for EWS-FLI-1, EWS-ERG and FUS-ERG expression and assessed the corresponding expression profile changes. Whereas all MPC isolates tested could stably express EWS-FLI-1, only some sustained stable EWS-ERG expression and none could express FUS-ERG for more than 3-5 days. Only 14% and 4% of the total number of genes that were respectively induced and repressed in MPCs by the three fusion proteins were shared. However, all three fusion proteins, but neither FLI-1 nor ERG-1 alone, activated the IGF1 promoter and induced IGF1 expression.

In particular, CS-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the MIC at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CS-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin.

To identify factors possibly involved in the establishment of equine pregnancy, the endometrium was collected from day 13 (day 0=day of ovulation) cyclic and day 13, 19 and 25 pregnant animals. From initial subtractive hybridization studies, a calcium regulating factor, Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) mRNA, was found as a candidate molecule expressed uniquely in the pregnant endometrium. Endometrial expression of STC1 mRNA was noted on day 19 and was markedly increased in the day 25 gravid endometrium. STC1 protein was found in the extracts of day 25 gravid endometrium and immunochemically localized in the uterine glands. In addition, STC1 protein was detected in uterine flushing media collected from day 25 pregnant mares. High concentrations of estradiol-17 \u03b2 (E(2)) were detected in day 25 conceptuses. E(2) levels were much higher in the gravid endometrium than in other regions, whereas progesterone levels did not differ among the samples from different endometrial regions. Expression of STC1 mRNA, however, was not significantly upregulated in cultured endometrial explants treated with various concentrations of E(2) (0.01-100 ng/ml) with or without 10 ng/ml progesterone. These results indicate that an increase in STC1 expression appears to coincide with capsule disappearance in the conceptus, and suggest that STC1 from the uterine glands likely plays a role in conceptus development during the pregnancy establishment period in the mare.", "meta": {"pmid": 21139325}}
{"text": "We demonstrate histological evidence for hyperparathyroidism in patients with gastrectomy. This is, at least in part, explained by impaired calcium absorption, resulting in mineralization defects and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, we demonstrate improved bone mineralization in patients with gastrectomy after gluconate therapy and showed the effectiveness of calcium gluconate over carbonate to balance impaired calcium hemostasis in mice. Gastrectomy and hypochlorhydria due to long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy are associated with increased fracture risk because of intestinal calcium malabsorption. Hence, our objectives were to histologically investigate bone metabolism in patients with gastrectomy and to analyze the impact of calcium gluconate supplementation on skeletal integrity in the setting of impaired gastric acidification. Undecalcified bone biopsies of 26 gastrectomized individuals were histologically analyzed. In the clinical setting, we retrospectively identified 5 gastrectomized patients with sufficient vitamin D level, who were additionally supplemented with calcium gluconate and had a real bone mineral density (aBMD) follow-up assessments. A mouse model of achlorhydria (ATP4b-/-) was used to compare the effect of calcium gluconate and calcium carbonate supplementation on bone metabolism. Biopsies from gastrectomized individuals showed significantly increased osteoid, osteoclast, and osteoblast indices and fibroosteoclasia (p < 0.05) as well as impaired calcium distribution in mineralized bone matrix compared to healthy controls. Five gastrectomized patients with sufficient vitamin D level demonstrated a significant increase in aBMD after a treatment with calcium gluconate alone for at least 6 months (p < 0.05). Calcium gluconate was superior to calcium carbonate in maintaining calcium metabolism in a mouse model of achlorhydria. Gastrectomy is associated with severe osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, and impaired calcium distribution within the mineralized matrix. We show that calcium gluconate supplementation can increase bone mineral density in gastrectomized individuals and performs superior to calcium carbonate in restoring calcium/skeletal homoeostasis in a mouse model of achlorhydria.", "meta": {"pmid": 25391248}}
{"text": "The septins are a family of GTPase enzymes required for cytokinesis and play a role in exocytosis. Among the ten vertebrate septins, Sept5 (CDCrel-1) and Sept3 (G-septin) are primarily concentrated in the brain, wherein Sept3 is a substrate for PKG-I (cGMP-dependent protein kinase-I) in nerve terminals. There are two motifs for potential PKG-I phosphorylation in Sept3, Thr-55 and Ser-91, but phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the primary site is a serine. Derivatization of phosphoserine to S-propylcysteine followed by N-terminal sequence analysis revealed Ser-91 as a major phosphorylation site. Tandem MS revealed a single phosphorylation site at Ser-91. Substitution of Ser-91 with Ala in a synthetic peptide abolished phosphorylation. Mutation of Ser-91 to Ala in recombinant Sept3 also abolished PKG phosphorylation, confirming that Ser-91 is the major site in vitro. Antibodies raised against a peptide containing phospho-Ser-91 detected phospho-Sept3 only in the cytosol of nerve terminals, whereas Sept3 was located in a peripheral membrane extract. Therefore Sept3 is phosphorylated on Ser-91 in nerve terminals and its phosphorylation may contribute to the regulation of its subcellular localization in neurons.", "meta": {"pmid": 15107017}}

The first locus for familial combined hyperlipidemia on 1q21-23 revealed a gene encoding a transcription factor critical in lipid and glucose metabolism, USF1. All the associated variants represent noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms, one of which affects the binding site of nuclear proteins with a putative effect on transcript levels of USF1. Transcript analyses of fat biopsies have exposed risk-allele related changes in the downstream genes. Another recent clue to the molecular pathogenesis of familial combined hyperlipidemia is the association of the high triglyceride trait with the APOA5 gene, located on 11q. More familial combined hyperlipidemia genes are expected to be found, since linkage evidence exists for additional loci on 16q24 and 20q12-q13.1. Genetic research of familial combined hyperlipidemia families has revealed several linked loci guiding to susceptibility genes. The USF1 transcription factor is the major gene underlying the 1q21-23 linkage.

Mutations in the closely related gene TTBK2 cause spinocerebellar ataxia, type 11. However, it remains unknown whether altered TTBK1 activity alone can drive neurodegeneration. In order to characterize the consequences of neuronal TTBK1 upregulation in adult brains, we have generated a transgenic mouse model with inducible pan-neuronal expression of human TTBK1. We find that these inducible TTBK1 transgenic mice (iTTBK1 Tg) exhibit motor and cognitive phenotypes, including decreased grip strength, hyperactivity, limb-clasping, and spatial memory impairment. These behavioral phenotypes occur in conjunction with progressive weight loss, neuroinflammation, and severe cerebellar degeneration with Purkinje neuron loss. Phenotype onset begins weeks after TTBK1 induction, culminating in average mortality around 7\u00a0weeks post induction. The iTTBK1 Tg animals lack any obvious accumulation of pathological tau or TDP-43, indicating that TTBK1 expression drives neurodegeneration in the absence of detectable pathological protein deposition. In exploring TTBK1 functions, we identified the autophagy related protein GABARAP to be a novel interacting partner of TTBK1 and show that GABARAP protein levels increase in the brain following induction of TTBK1.

The majority of these interactions are metabolic and are caused by inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated hepatic and/or small intestinal metabolism of coadministered drugs. Human liver microsomal studies in vitro, clinical case reports and controlled pharmacokinetic interaction studies in patients or healthy volunteers are reviewed. A brief overview of the CYP system and the contrasting effects of the antifungal agents on the different human drug-metabolising CYP isoforms is followed by discussion of the role of P-glycoprotein in presystemic extraction and the modulation of its function by the antifungal agents. Methods used for in vitro drug interaction studies and in vitro-in vivo scaling are then discussed, with specific emphasis on the azole antifungals. Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent inhibitors of the major drug-metabolising CYP isoform in humans, CYP3A4. Coadministration of these drugs with CYP3A substrates such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, alprazolam, triazolam, midazolam, nifedipine, felodipine, simvastatin, lovastatin, vincristine, terfenadine or astemizole can result in clinically significant drug interactions, some of which can be life-threatening. The interactions of ketoconazole with cyclosporin and tacrolimus have been applied for therapeutic purposes to allow a lower dosage and cost of the immunosuppressant and a reduced risk of fungal infections. The potency of fluconazole as a CYP3A4 inhibitor is much lower. Thus, clinical interactions of CYP3A substrates with this azole derivative are of lesser magnitude, and are generally observed only with fluconazole dosages of > or =200 mg/day. Fluconazole, miconazole and sulfamethoxazole are potent inhibitors of CYP2C9. Coadministration of phenytoin, warfarin, sulfamethoxazole and losartan with fluconazole results in clinically significant drug interactions. Fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 in vitro, although the clinical significance of this has not been investigated. No clinically significant drug interactions have been predicted or documented between the azoles and drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP1A2, 2D6 or 2E1. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions with coadministered substrates of this isoform, such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone.

The regulation of pH is critical for all living organisms. Although there are many studies in the literature on the biochemical, functional, and structural features of CAs, there is not sufficient information about the epigenetic regulation of CAs. The lysine acetyltransferase TIP60 (60\u00a0kDa Tat-interactive protein) was knocked out specifically in mouse liver using the Cre/loxP system, and knockout rate was shown as 83-88% by Southern blot analysis. The impact of Tip60 on the expression of Ca1, Ca3, and Ca7 was investigated at six Zeitgeber time (ZT) points in the control and liver-specific Tip60 knockout mice (mutant) groups by real-time PCR. In the control group, while Ca1 showed the highest expression at ZT8 and ZT12, the lowest expression profile was observed at ZT0 and ZT20. Hepatic Ca1 displayed robust circadian expression. However, hepatic Ca3 exhibited almost the same level of expression at all ZT points. The highest expression of Ca7 was observed at ZT12, and the lowest expression was determined at ZT4. Furthermore, hepatic Ca7 also showed robust circadian expression. The expression of Ca1 and Ca3 significantly decreased in mutant mice at all time periods, but the expression of Ca7 used as a negative control was not affected. It was suggested for the first time that Tip60 might be considered a candidate protein in the regulation of the Ca1 and Ca3 genes, possibly by acetylation.", "meta": {"pmid": 34651296}}

{"text": "Resistin, secreted by macrophages in tumor microenvironment, has never been investigated in pancreatic cancer models, despite a vibrant tumor microenvironment around pancreatic tumors. We evaluated serum resistin levels in healthy individuals versus pancreatic cancer patients representing different tumor grades. In vitro mechanistic analysis involved MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 cells. Resistin signaling depends on binding of resistin to its cognitive receptors. Therefore, we silenced adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), its two known receptors, individually as well as in combination, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Effect of resistin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and sensitivity to gemcitabine was studied without or with silencing of resistin receptors CAP1 and/or TLR4. The results were also confirmed in vivo in mice xenografted with MiaPaCa-2 cells without or with receptor silencing. We report high resistin levels in pancreatic cancer patients which correlate positively with tumor grades. We observed a marked reduction in the resistin-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2 and SW1990 when the receptors were silenced. The results were confirmed in vivo wherein resistin effects were significantly attenuated in MiaPaCa-2 xenografts with silenced receptors. The combined silencing of CAP1 and TLR4 was found to be most effective in vitro and in vivo. We found activation of STAT3 by resistin in vivo and in vitro which was dependent on the presence of CAP1 and TLR4. Further, resistin was found to induce resistance to gemcitabine through its receptors. Our results describe novel functional roles of resistin with implications toward a better understanding of pancreatic tumor microenvironment.", "meta": {"pmid": 30317640}}

Pharmaceuticals are an important class of emerging environmental micropollutants: their presence in water bodies is an increasing environmental concern. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in freshwater aquatic environments in the African and European context. A literature survey has been performed, resulting in 3024 data points related to environmental occurrence. The concentration levels of 71 pharmaceuticals were assessed. The top ten most frequently detected and quantified compounds in both continents were sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, diclofenac, trimethoprim, ibuprofen, naproxen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), ketoprofen, venlafaxine and clarithromycin. The maximum concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol, estriol, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, paracetamol, naproxen reported in African aquatic environments were ~3140, ~20,000, ~125, ~100, ~215 and ~171 times higher, respectively, than the concentrations reported in European based studies. The variation in pharmaceutical consumption, partial removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater treatment processes, and the direct discharge of livestock animal farm wastewater were identified among the major reasons for the observed differences. Several pharmaceuticals were found in aquatic environments of both continents in concentration levels higher than their ecotoxicity endpoints. In Europe, compounds such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, triclosan, sulfadimidine, carbamazepine and fluoxetine were reported in a concentration higher than the available ecotoxicity endpoints. In Africa, much more compounds reached concentrations more than the ecotoxicity endpoints, including diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol, naproxen, ciprofloxacin, triclosan, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and fluoxetine, estriol and 17\u03b2-estradiol.

To investigate the differentially expressed proteins from PCOS patients versus             healthy women, the protein expression in follicular fluid was analyzed using two-dimensional             electrophoresis (2-DE). Since follicular fluid contains a number of secretory             proteins required for oocyte fertilization and follicle maturation, it is possible             that follicular fluid can be used as a provisional source for identifying pivotal             proteins associated with PCOS.

Here we show that AQP6 is localized exclusively in intracellular membranes in renal epithelia. By using a polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of AQP6, immunoblots revealed a major 30-kDa band in membranes from rat renal cortex and medulla. Endoglycosidase treatment demonstrated presence of an intracellular high mannose glycan on each subunit. Sequential ultracentrifugation of rat kidney homogenates confirmed that AQP6 resides predominantly in vesicular fractions, and immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic studies confirmed that >98% of AQP6 is located in intracellular membrane vesicles. In glomeruli, AQP6 is present in membrane vesicles within podocyte cell bodies and foot processes. In proximal tubules, AQP6 is also abundant in membrane vesicles within the subapical compartment of segment 2 and segment 3 cells, but was not detected in the brush border or basolateral membranes. In collecting duct, AQP6 resides in intracellular membrane vesicles in apical, mid, and basolateral cytoplasm of type A intercalated cells, but was not observed in the plasma membrane. Unlike other members of the AQP family, the unique distribution in intracellular membrane vesicles in multiple types of renal epithelia indicates that AQP6 is not simply involved in transcellular fluid absorption. Moreover, our studies predict that AQP6 participates in distinct physiological functions such as glomerular filtration, tubular endocytosis, and acid-base metabolism.", "meta": {"pmid": 10318966}}

Although the level of TRH in the lumbar enlargement was significantly reduced in 5,6-DHT-treated rats, the effects of TRH on the monosynaptic reflex (MSR) and the polysynaptic reflex (PSR) in these rats were no different from those in control rats. MSR inhibition by 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) was attenuated by 5,6-DHT treatment although there was no obvious difference in the effects of 5-MeODMT on the PSR between 5,6-DHT-treated and control rats. In 5,6-DHT-treated rats, L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) markedly decreased the MSR and increased the PSR although the same doses of 5-HTP did not produce any effects on either the MSR or the PSR in control rats. In control rats, after administration of imipramine or clorgyline, 5-HTP produced effects similar to those observed in 5,6-DHT-treated rats. These results suggest that the supersensitivity to 5-HTP in 5,6-DHT-treated rats is due to a lack of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake into 5-HT-containing nerve terminals rather than to a change in 5-HT receptors.", "meta": {"pmid": 3117574}}

Understanding how interdomain interactions in Ncb5or facilitate the shuttling of electrons from NAD(P)H to heme, and how the process compares with the microsomal b5 (Cyb5A) and b5R (Cyb5R3) system, is of interest. A high-resolution structure of the b5 domain (PDB entry 3lf5) has previously been reported, which exhibits substantial differences in comparison to Cyb5A. The structural characterization of a construct comprising the naturally fused CS and b5R domains with bound FAD and NAD+ (PDB entry 6mv1) or NADP+ (PDB entry 6mv2) is now reported. The structures reveal that the linker between the CS and b5R cores is more ordered than predicted, with much of it extending the \u03b2-sandwich motif of the CS domain. This limits the flexibility between the two domains, which recognize one another via a short \u03b2-sheet motif and a network of conserved side-chain hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and cation-\u03c0 interactions. Notable differences in FAD-protein interactions in Ncb5or and Cyb5R3 provide insight into the selectivity for docking of their respective b5 redox partners. The structures also afford a structural explanation for the unusual ability of Ncb5or to utilize both NADH and NADPH, and represent the first examples of native, fully oxidized b5R family members in which the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P)+ resides in the active site. Finally, the structures, together with sequence alignments, show that the b5R domain is more closely related to single-domain Cyb5R proteins from plants, fungi and some protists than to Cyb5R3 from animals.", "meta": {"pmid": 31282472}}
{"text": "Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) is a core component of the hPrP19 complex that controls RNA splicing. Here, we performed an exon array assay and showed that \u03b2-catenin is a target of BCAS2 splicing regulation. The regulation of dendrite growth and morphology by \u03b2-catenin is well documented. Therefore, we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice to eliminate the BCAS2 expression in the forebrain to investigate the role of BCAS2 in dendrite growth. BCAS2 cKO mice showed a microcephaly-like phenotype with a reduced volume in the dentate gyrus (DG) and low levels of learning and memory, as evaluated using Morris water maze analysis and passive avoidance, respectively. Golgi staining revealed shorter dendrites, less dendritic complexity and decreased spine density in the DG of BCAS2 cKO mice. Moreover, the cKO mice displayed a short dendrite length in newborn neurons labeled by DCX, a marker of immature neurons, and BrdU incorporation. To further examine the mechanism underlying BCAS2-mediated dendritic malformation, we overexpressed \u03b2-catenin in BCAS2-depleted primary neurons and found that the dendritic growth was restored. In summary, BCAS2 is an upstream regulator of \u03b2-catenin gene expression and plays a role in dendrite growth at least partly through \u03b2-catenin.", "meta": {"pmid": 27713508}}

Our goals, therefore, were to identify PAC1 expressing cells morphologically, investigate the PACAP1-38 action functionally, and establish PACAP1-38 regulated events developmentally during the first postnatal week in rat retina. P1 retinal sections or whole mounts of Wistar rats were used to reveal PAC1 and calbindin immunoreactive structures. P1, P3, or P7 pups were injected intravitreally with 100 pmol PACAP1-38. Tissues were harvested 24 hours post-treatment, then processed for calbindin immunohistochemistry to determine horizontal cell number, or 6, 12, 24 hours post-treatment for real-time PCR and immunoblots to detect PCNA expression. To localize proliferating cells, anti-PCNA antibody was applied. We showed various PAC1 expressing cells in RPE, NBL, and GCL in P1 retina including calbindin positive horizontal cells. We found that PACAP1-38 induced a marked cell number increase at P3 and P7 and showed upregulated cell proliferation as its mechanism; however, it was ineffective at P1. PACAP1-38 induced proliferative cells localized in the NBL, and double-marker studies demonstrated that the induced proliferative cells were horizontal cells. PACAP1-38 appears to act in retinal differentiation by inducing mitosis selectively in a time and cell specific manner through PAC1. The control of horizontal cell proliferation raises the novel possibilities that (1) PACAP1-38 may be a major player in retinal patterning and (2) PACAP signaling may be critical in retinoblastoma.", "meta": {"pmid": 30795011}}

We hypothesized reduced BIL exposure in peripheral tissues explains the latter, and in this study assessed the adipose tissue interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of BIL compared with human insulin (HI). A euglycemic glucose clamp was performed in patients with type 1 diabetes during continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of BIL or HI, while the adipose ISF insulin concentrations were determined using open-flow microperfusion (OFM).

Steady-state BIL concentrations in adipose tissue ISF were achieved by \u223c16\u2009h after IV infusion. Median time to reach steady-state glucose infusion rate across doses ranged between 8 and 22\u2009h.

{"text": "Vitamin B6 is present in our diet in many forms, however, only pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) can function as a cofactor for enzymes. The intestine absorbs nonphosphorylated B6 vitamers, which are converted by specific enzymes to the active PLP form. The role of PLP is enabled by its reactive aldehyde group. Pathways reliant on PLP include amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism, folate and 1-carbon metabolism, protein and polyamine synthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and erythropoiesis. Besides the role of PLP as a cofactor B6 vitamers also play other cellular roles, for example, as antioxidants, modifying expression and action of steroid hormone receptors, affecting immune function, as chaperones and as an antagonist of Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) at P2 purinoceptors. Because of the vital role of PLP in neurotransmitter metabolism, particularly synthesis of the inhibitory transmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, it is not surprising that various inborn errors leading to PLP deficiency manifest as B6 -responsive epilepsy, usually of early onset. This includes pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase deficiency (a disorder affecting PLP synthesis and recycling), disorders affecting PLP import into the brain (hypophosphatasia and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis defects), a disorder of an intracellular PLP-binding protein (PLPBP, previously named PROSC) and disorders where metabolites accumulate that inactivate PLP, for example, ALDH7A1 deficiency and hyperprolinaemia type II. Patients with these disorders can show rapid control of seizures in response to either pyridoxine and/or PLP with a lifelong dependency on supraphysiological vitamin B6 supply.

Despite such specificity, all RINGs characterized till date bind unloaded E2s with dissociation constants (Kds) in the micromolar to the sub-millimolar range. Here, we show that the RING domain of E3 ligase ZNRF1, an essential E3 ligase implicated in diverse cellular pathways, binds Ube2N with a Kd of \u223c50\u2005nM. This high-affinity interaction is exclusive for Ube2N as ZNRF1 interacts with Ube2D2 with a Kd of \u223c1\u2005\u00b5M, alike few other E3s. The crystal structure of ZNRF1 C-terminal domain in complex with Ube2N coupled with mutational analyses reveals the molecular basis of this unusual affinity. We further demonstrate that the ubiquitination efficiency of ZNRF1\u2009:\u2009E2 pairs correlates with their affinity. Intriguingly, as a consequence of its high E2 affinity, an excess of ZNRF1 inhibits Ube2N-mediated ubiquitination at concentrations \u2265500\u2005nM instead of showing enhanced ubiquitination. This suggests a novel mode of activity regulation of E3 ligases and emphasizes the importance of E3-E2 balance for the optimum activity.

AGS cells were treated with TSA or 5'-AzaDC and methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) analysis were performed. MSP analysis was on DNA from paraffin embedded tissues sections and plasma. Expression analysis revealed downregulation of ATP4A and ATP4B genes in gastric cancer cell lines relative to normal gastric tissue, while treatment with 5'-AzaDC re-activated expression of both. Search for CpG islands in their putative promoter regions did not indicate CpG islands (CGI) but only further downstream in the bodies of the genes. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) in the exon1 of the ATP4B gene and exon7 in ATP4A indicated methylation in all the gastric cancer cell lines tested. MSP analysis in tumor tissue samples revealed methylation in the majority of tumor samples, 15/19, for ATP4B and 8/8 for ATP4A. There was concordance between ATP4B and ATP4A down-regulation and methylation status in the tumour samples tested.

In the liver and pancreas, with little cell turnover and no obvious stem cell markers, the importance of regenerative hyperplasia associated with chronic inflammation to tumour initiation is vividly apparent, though inflammatory conditions in the renewing populations are also permissive for tumour induction. In the liver, hepatocytes, biliary epithelial cells and hepatic progenitor cells are embryologically related, and all can give rise to hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. In the exocrine pancreas, both acinar and ductal cells can give rise to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), although the preceding preneoplastic states are quite different: acinar-ductal metaplasia gives rise to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia culminating in PDAC, while ducts give rise to PDAC via. mucinous cell metaplasia that may have a polyclonal origin.", "meta": {"pmid": 32794627}}
{"text": "Malignancy is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients. The pathophysiology of hypercalcemia of malignancy (HM) is complex. Increased bone resorption is involved in most cases caused either by extensive local bone destruction or by humoral factors. Tumor extracts from patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) often contain PTH-like bioactivity. Recently, cDNAs coding for a PTH-related protein (PTH-rP) has been cloned. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein shows a considerable homology with human PTH. However, other bone resorbing factors including prostaglandins, transforming growth factors, colony stimulating factors, leucocyte cytokines and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may be involved in different types of malignancy. HM is usually progressive with troublesome symptoms and a high mortality. Several treatment alternatives are available including rehydration, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, plicamycin, phosphate, and glucocorticoids. Others are under investigation. Treatment should be individualized taking into account the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, the extent of hypercalcemia and renal failure, and the prognosis related to the malignant disease.", "meta": {"pmid": 1883526}}
{"text": "In the growing ovarian follicle, the maturing oocyte is accompanied by cumulus (CCs) and granulosa (GCs) cells. Currently, there remain many unanswered questions about the epithelial origin of these cells. Global and targeted gene transcript levels were assessed on 1, 7, 15, 30 days of culture for CCs and GCs. Detailed analysis of the genes belonging to epithelial cell-associated ontological groups allowed us to assess a total of 168 genes expressed in CCs (97 genes) and GCs (71 genes) during long-term in vitro culture. Expression changes of the analyzed genes allowed the identification of the group of genes: TGFBR3, PTGS2, PRKX, AHI1, and IL11, whose expression decreased the most and the group of ANXA3, DKK1, CCND1, STC1, CAV1, and SFRP4 genes, whose expression significantly increased. These genes' expression indicates CCs and GCs epithelialization processes and their epithelial origin. Expression change analysis of genes involved in epithelization processes in GCs and CCs during their in vitro culture made it possible to describe the most significantly altered of the 11 genes. Detailed analysis of gene expression in these two cell populations at different time intervals confirms their ovarian surface epithelial origin. Furthermore, some gene expression profiles appear to have tumorigenic properties, suggesting that granulosa cells may play a role in cancerogenesis.", "meta": {"pmid": 35011815}}

{"text": "Over the last decade there has been growing evidence that Brain Expressed X-Linked 2 (BEX2) has a significant role in the process of carcinogenesis. Collectively, available studies suggest a pro-oncogenic function for this gene in multiple malignancies, including breast, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers in addition to brain tumors. The identification of BEX2 in breast cancer resulted from gene expression microarray studies. Subsequent studies showed that BEX2 promotes breast cancer cell growth and survival by modulating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and G1 cell cycle. In this process, BEX2 has cross-talk with the NF-\u03baB, c-Jun/JNK and ErbB2 pathways. Of note, several studies have found a pro-oncogenic function for BEX2 in other malignancies associated with a similar signaling function to that observed in breast cancer. In brain tumors, BEX2 promotes cell migration and invasion in oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma cells. In addition, BEX2 expression protects glioma cells against apoptosis mediated through the JNK pathway and is required for glioma cell proliferation through the NF-\u03baB p65. Furthermore, it has been shown that BEX2 promotes cell proliferation through the JNK/c-Jun pathway and regulates JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation in colorectal cancer. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that BEX2 expression is required for cell proliferation and Hepatitis B Virus-mediated development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, a pro-oncogenic function for BEX2 is supported by reproducible data in multiple malignancies and the NF-\u03baB and JNK/c-Jun pathways are commonly regulated by BEX2 in this process. In view of these findings, targeting BEX2 may provide an attractive therapeutic strategy in multiple malignancies.", "meta": {"pmid": 30779920}}
{"text": "To observe the clinical effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with interventional recanalization therapy in the treatment of tubal obstructive infertility, first, different treatment approaches were used on rabbits, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that interventional recanalization combined with TCM can significantly ameliorate the pathological condition of the fallopian tube after treatment. Moreover, ELISA disclosed that the treatment could significantly reduce the levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and increase the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), which demonstrated that TCM therapy can help against inflammation of the fallopian tubes. PCR array analysis revealed that BMP4, BMPR1A, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, and KLF10 expressions were upregulated, and SMAD7 expression was downregulated, proving that combined treatment could influence gene expression in the TGF-\u03b2 family and further regulate the secretion of proteins in SMADs. In addition, a clinical study recorded the fallopian tube patency rate of 165 patients after 12\u2009months. The recanalization rates in the two groups were 81.9% and 53.1%, with the higher rates in the combined medicine enema group. All these findings implied that interventional recanalization combined with TCM preparation has a stronger effect.

Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively. Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions. Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates. Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises. Using the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and targeted toward the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly. This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course. These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof our health care systems by proactively mining, synthesizing, cataloging, and evaluating the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well-established, and affordable generic drugs.", "meta": {"pmid": 32374264}}
{"text": "P(II) signal transduction proteins are highly conserved in bacteria, archaea and plants and have key functions in coordination of central metabolism by integrating signals from the carbon, nitrogen and energy status of the cell. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, P(II) binds ATP and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) in a synergistic manner, with the ATP binding sites also accepting ADP. Depending on its effector molecule binding status, P(II) (from this cyanobacterium and other oxygenic phototrophs) complexes and regulates the arginine-controlled enzyme of the cyclic ornithine pathway, N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK), to control arginine biosynthesis. To gain deeper insights into the process of P(II) binding to NAGK, we searched for P(II) variants with altered binding characteristics and found P(II) variants I86N and I86T to be able to bind to an NAGK variant (R233A) that was previously shown to be unable to bind wild-type P(II) protein. Analysis of interactions between these P(II) variants and wild-type NAGK as well as with the NAGK R233A variant suggested that the P(II) I86N variant was a superactive NAGK binder. To reveal the structural basis of this property, we solved the crystal structure of the P(II) I86N variant at atomic resolution. The large T-loop, which prevails in most receptor interactions of P(II) proteins, is present in a tightly bended conformation that mimics the T-loop of S. elongatus P(II) after having latched onto NAGK. Moreover, both P(II) I86 variants display a specific defect in 2-OG binding, implying a role of residue I86 in 2-OG binding. We propose a two-step model for the mechanism of P(II)-NAGK complex formation: in an initiating step, a contact between R233 of NAGK and E85 of P(II) initiates the bending of the extended T-loop of P(II), followed by a second step, where a bended T-loop deeply inserts into the NAGK clefts to form the tight complex.", "meta": {"pmid": 20399792}}

Although the disease is relatively rare, it is responsible for considerable mortality due to frequent metastasis and chemoresistance. The molecular events related to LMS metastasis are unknown to date. The present study compared the global gene expression patterns of primary uterine LMSs and LMS metastases. Gene expression profiles of 13 primary and 15 metastatic uterine LMSs were analyzed using the HumanRef-8 BeadChip from Illumina. Differentially expressed candidate genes were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. To identify differently expressed genes between primary and metastatic tumors, we performed one-way analysis of variance with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. This led to identification of 203 unique probes that were significantly differentially expressed in the 2 tumor groups by greater than 1.58-fold with P < .01, of which 94 and 109 were overexpressed in primary and metastatic LMSs, respectively. Genes overexpressed in primary uterine LMSs included OSTN, NLGN4X, NLGN1, SLITRK4, MASP1, XRN2, ASS1, RORB, HRASLS, and TSPAN7. Genes overexpressed in LMS metastases included TNNT1, FOLR3, TDO2, CRYM, GJA1, TSPAN10, THBS1, SGK1, SHMT1, EGR2, and AGT. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed significant anatomical site-related differences in FOLR3, OSTN, and NLGN4X levels; and immunohistochemistry showed significant differences in TDO2 expression.

Non-canonical WNT signals, regulated by the interaction of WNT, WNT antagonist, Frizzled and ROR2, are transduced to JNK, ROCK, PKC, MAP3K7, and NFAT signaling cascades. PCP signals, regulated by the interaction of VANGL-PRICKLE complex, CELSR and Frizzled-DVL complex, are transduced to JNK, ROCK, and other uncharacterized signaling cascades. PTK7 signaling, regulated by SEMA6 and Plexin-A family members, affects PCP pathway through VANGL.

Western blot analysis of neutrophil homogenates indicated that the MM of the KLKs ranged from 27 to 50\u2009kDa.

{"text": "Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DIIT) is a relatively uncommon adverse reaction caused by drug-dependent antibodies (DDAbs) that react with platelet membrane glycoproteins only when the implicated drug is present. Although more than 100 drugs have been associated with causing DIIT, recent reviews of available data show that carbamazepine, eptifibatide, ibuprofen, quinidine, quinine, oxaliplatin, rifampin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and vancomycin are probably the most frequently implicated. Patients with DIIT typically present with petechiae, bruising, and epistaxis caused by an acute, severe drop in platelet count (often to <20,000 platelets/pL). Diagnosis of DIIT is complicated by its similarity to other non-drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias, including autoimmune thrombocytopenia, posttransfusion purpura, and platelet transfusion refractoriness, and must be differentiated by temporal association of exposure to a candidate drug with an acute, severe drop in platelet count. Treatment consists of immediate withdrawal of the implicated drug. Criteria for strong evidence of DIIT include (1) exposure to candidate drug-preceded thrombocytopenia; (2) sustained normal platelet levels after discontinuing candidate drug; (3) candidate drug was only drug used before onset of thrombocytopenia or other drugs were continued or reintroduced after resolution of thrombocytopenia, and other causes for thrombocytopenia were excluded; and (4) reexposure to the candidate drug resulted in recurrent thrombocytopenia. Flow cytometry testing for DDAbs can be useful in confirmation of a clinical diagnosis, and monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing can be used to determine the platelet glycoprotein target(s), usually GPIIb/IIIa or GPIb/IX/V, but testing is not widely available. Several pathogenic mechanisms for DIIT have been proposed, including hapten, autoantibody, neoepitope, drug-specific, and quinine-type drug mechanisms.

This exploratory study investigated the immunologic mechanism of action of subcutaneous S-588410 emulsified with MONTANIDE ISA51VG adjuvant (median: 5 doses) by analyzing the expression of immune-related molecules, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response and T-lymphocytes bearing peptide-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in tumor tissue or blood samples from 15 participants with HLA-A*24:02-positive esophageal cancer. Densities of CD8+, CD8+ Granzyme B+, CD8+ programmed death-1-positive (PD-1+) and programmed death-ligand 1-positive (PD-L1+) cells were higher in post- versus pre-vaccination tumor tissue. CTL response was induced in all patients for at least one of five peptides. The same sequences of peptide-specific TCRs were identified in post-vaccination T-lymphocytes derived from both tumor tissue and blood, suggesting that functional peptide-specific CTLs infiltrate tumor tissue after vaccination.

A distinctive feature of this trafficking is that CaV1.1 expresses poorly or not at all in mammalian cells that are not of muscle origin (e.g., tsA201 cells), in which all of the other nine CaV isoforms have been successfully expressed. Here, we tested whether plasma membrane trafficking of CaV1.1 in tsA201 cells is promoted by the adapter protein Stac3, because recent work has shown that genetic deletion of Stac3 in skeletal muscle causes the loss of EC coupling. Using fluorescently tagged constructs, we found that Stac3 and CaV1.1 traffic together to the tsA201 plasma membrane, whereas CaV1.1 is retained intracellularly when Stac3 is absent. Moreover, L-type Ca(2+) channel function in tsA201 cells coexpressing Stac3 and CaV1.1 is quantitatively similar to that in myotubes, despite the absence of RyR1. Although Stac3 is not required for surface expression of CaV1.2, the principle subunit of the cardiac/brain L-type Ca(2+) channel, Stac3 does bind to CaV1.2 and, as a result, greatly slows the rate of current inactivation, with Stac2 acting similarly. Overall, these results indicate that Stac3 is an essential chaperone of CaV1.1 in skeletal muscle and that in the brain, Stac2 and Stac3 may significantly modulate CaV1.2 function.

Three of them (rilpivirine, cobicistat, dolutegravir) have shown some interactions with renal function, while tenofovir alafenamide fumarate reduces the plasmatic concentration of the parent drug. The future use of tenofovir alafenamide seems to be encouraging in order to reduce the renal interaction of tenofovir. Rilpivirine, cobicistat, and dolutegravir reduce the tubular secretion of creatinine, inducing a decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate according to creatinine. Rilpivirine and dolutegravir block the uptake of creatinine from the blood, inhibiting organic cation transporter 2, and cobicistat interacts with the efflux inhibiting multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1. This effect can then be considered a \"reset\" of the estimated glomerular filtration rate according to creatinine. However, clinicians should carefully monitor renal function in order to identify possible alterations suggestive of a true renal functional impairment. Owing to the interference of these drugs with creatinine secretion, an alternative way of estimation of glomerular filtration rate would be desirable. However, at the moment, other methods of direct glomerular filtration rate measurement have a high impact on the patient, are not readily available, or are not reliable in HIV patients. Consequently, use of classic formulas to estimate glomerular filtration rate is still recommended.

However, the involvement of CASP9 in autophagy and its molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report the non-apoptotic function of CASP9 in positive regulation of autophagy through maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Growth factor or amino acid deprivation-induced autophagy activated CASP9, but without apoptotic features. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of CASP9 decreased autophagy flux, while ectopic expression of CASP9 rescued autophagy defects. In CASP9 knockout (KO) cells, initiation and elongation of phagophore membranes were normal, but sealing of the membranes and autophagosome maturation were impaired, and the lifetime of autophagosomes was prolonged. Ablation of CASP9 caused an accumulation of inactive ATG3 and decreased lipidation of the Atg8-family members, most severely that of GABARAPL1. Moreover, it resulted in abnormal mitochondrial morphology with depolarization of the membrane potential, reduced reactive oxygen species production, and aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial fusion-fission proteins. CASP9 expression or exogenously added H2O2 in the CASP9 KO cells corrected the ATG3 level and lipidation status of Atg8-family members, and restored autophagy flux. Of note, only CASP9 expression but not H2O2 rescued mitochondrial defects, revealing regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by CASP9.

The validity of the approach is established by applying it to substrate/enzyme complexes of pharmacological relevance: mono-ADP-ribose (ADPr) in complex with mono-ADP-ribosylation hydrolases (MacroD1 and MacroD2), where induced-fit phenomena are known to be significant. The calculated binding free energies are consistent with experiments, with an absolute error smaller than 0.5 kcal/mol. Our simulations reveal that in all circumstances, the active loops, delimiting the boundaries of the binding site, undergo significant conformation rearrangements upon ligand binding. The calculations further provide, for the first time, the molecular basis of ADPr specificity and the relative changes in its experimental binding affinity on passing from MacroD1 to MacroD2 and all its mutants. Our study paves the way to the quantitative description of induced-fit events in molecular recognition.", "meta": {"pmid": 34813698}}

Functional studies by others demonstrated a predominant role for Batf in controlling Th2 cell functions and lineage development of T lymphocytes as well as a critical role of Batf, Batf2 and Batf3 in CD8\u03b1+dendritic cell development. Moreover, Batf family member expression was measured in a vast collection of mouse and human cell types by cap analysis gene expression (CAGE), a recent developed sequencing technology, showing reasonable expression spectrum in immune cells consistent with previously published expression profiles. Batf and Batf3 were highly expressed in lymphocytes and the earlier moderately expressed in myeloid lineages. Batf2 was predominantly expressed in monocytes/macrophages. Functional studies in mice demonstrated that Batf2 has a central role in macrophage activation by regulating inflammatory responses during lipopolysaccharides stimulation and mycobacterial infection. Hence, Batf2 could be used as a biomarker and a potential host directed drug target in tuberculosis. Moreover, Batf2 act as a tumor suppressor gene and augmenting Batf2 in malignant cells might be an encouraging therapeutic treatment against cancer. ", "meta": {"pmid": 26376615}}
{"text": "Mortality and morbidity in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), caused principally by plaque erosion or rupture leading to thrombus formation and myocardial ischemia, have been reduced by a combination of antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants) and early revascularization. Aspirin is the foundation antiplatelet agent. New P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) have clear benefits compared with clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy, and cangrelor or vorapaxar, a thrombin receptor inhibitor, may be of value in specific settings. Anticoagulation uses 1 of 4 choices: bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux. Moreover, some patients (such as those who have chronic atrial fibrillation) require triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, plus an anticoagulant, frequently a vitamin K antagonist. New oral anticoagulants have been shown to be at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists in atrial fibrillation and led to fewer bleeding complications. Finally, the combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and low-dose rivaroxaban has recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency (but not the Food and Drug Administration) for secondary prevention after ACS. Several strategies have been developed to balance the potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy against the risk of bleeding complications, for example, radial access in coronary angiography or restricted use of combination therapy, and others are under investigation, such as discontinuation of aspirin. This overview summarizes the current status of antithrombotic therapy in ACS and describes strategies currently explored to optimize its benefit/risk ratio. ", "meta": {"pmid": 25440788}}

However, the effect of ARHGAP42 in promoting cell malignancy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is demonstrated in this study. Microarray and real-time quantitative PCR were used for a mRNA profiling of ARHGAP42 in nasopharyngeal primary and metastatic carcinoma tissues. Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used for detecting the expression of ARHGAP42 protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cell lines. The overexpression and silence experiments of ARHGAP42 were performed in NPC cell lines using siRNA and expressive plasmid for evaluating cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Real-time quantitative PCR, western blot, and transwell test were employed for with the function of ARHGAP42 and its antisense lncRNA uc010rul. We confirmed the elevated expression of ARHGAP42 in metastatic NPC tissues of mRNA and protein for the first time. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that NPC patients with highly ARHGAP42 expression were significantly associated with shorter metastasis-free survival. Knockdown of ARHGAP42 resulted in significant inhibition of nasopharyngeal cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro, and the overexpression of ARHGAP42 showed the opposite effects. In addition, the silence of uc010rul resulted in ARHGAP42 expression decrease and significant inhibition of nasopharyngeal cancer cell migration and invasion. High expression of ARHGAP42 is associated with poor metastasis-free survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. ARHGAP42 promotes migration and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells in vitro; the antisense lncRNA may be involved in this effect.", "meta": {"pmid": 29936709}}

Four dysgerminomas (DYSs) and four childhood endodermal sinus tumors (cESTs), resembling self-renewing and differentiating NSCs, respectively, were selected. Proteomic studies were performed by 2-DE, SDS-PAGE, and cLC/MS/MS with protein database searching. 2-DE: 9 of 941 spots were differentially regulated with greater than a twofold change in spot volume for at least three of four gels in each group. Two of nine spots had P values for the t-test analysis of comparisons less than 0.001, while the remaining spots had P values from 0.013 to 0.191. Top-ranked proteins were identified in nine of nine spots with 4.0-38% sequence coverage. APOA1, CRK, and PDIA3 were up-regulated in cESTs. TFG, TYMP, VCP, RBBP, FKBP4, and BiP were up-regulated in DYSs. SDS-PAGE: Up-regulation of NF45 and FKBP4 was observed in four of four cESTs and DYSs, respectively.

{"text": "The cullin proteins are a family of scaffolding proteins that associate with RING proteins and ubiquitin E3 ligases and mediate substrate-receptor bindings. Thus, cullin proteins regulate the specificity of ubiquitin targeting in the regulation of proteins involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. There are seven cullin proteins that have been identified in eukaryotes: CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, CUL4B, CUL5, and CUL7/p53-associated parkin-like cytoplasmic protein. All of these proteins contain a conserved cullin homology domain that binds to RING box proteins. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes are activated upon post-translational modification by neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally downregulated protein 8. The aberrant expression of several cullin proteins has been implicated in many cancers though the significance in gastric cancer has been less well investigated. This review provides the first systematic discussion of the associations between all members of the cullin protein family and gastric cancer. Functional and regulatory mechanisms of cullin proteins in gastric carcinoma progression are also summarized along with a discussion concerning future research areas. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of cullin proteins in tumorigenesis, and a better understanding of the function of these individual cullin proteins and their targets will help identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

The control of both, parasites and host immune response, is critical to prevent tissue destruction. The skin ulceration has been correlated with high TNF-\u03b1 level. Because human anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies (Ab) have been successfully assayed in several mice inflammatory diseases, we hypothesized that their anti-inflammatory effect could optimize the healing of CL lesions achieved after topical application of paromomycin (PM), the current chemotherapy against CL. We first compared the in vitro efficacy of PM and Ab alone and the drug given in combination with Ab to assess if the Ab could interfere with PM leishmanicidal activity in L. major-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages. The combination therapy had similar antileishmanial activity to the drug alone and showed no influence on NO production, which allows macrophage-mediated parasite killing. Next, we demonstrated in an in vivo model of Imiquimod\u00ae-induced inflammation that topical Ab and PM inhibit the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the skin. In the efficacy studies in L. major-infected BALB/c mice, PM combined with Ab led to a sharp infection reduction and showed a stronger anti-inflammatory activity than PM alone. This was confirmed by the down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, IL-17, and CCL3 as well as by a decrease of the neutrophilic infiltrate during infection upon treatment with the Ab.

Some patients had recurrent symptomatic flares without recurrent peripheral or tissue eosinophilia, in most cases after prolonged symptomatic remission and in the setting of liberalization of dietary restrictions and/or tapering of background therapy. Although eosinophil-associated histologic changes improved in all segments, epithelial changes persisted in the esophagus and stomach in patients with recurrent disease flares even after one year of treatment. Serum tryptase and GI mast cells were generally unchanged with treatment, and increases were not associated with disease flares. Serum levels of IL-4 and IL-5 increased with benralizumab treatment (both p<0.05).

Previous reports suggest that traditional sodium channel blockers (SCBs) such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine have a beneficial effect on SCN2A-related neonatal seizures, as they counteract the gain-of-function effect of mutated Nav1.2 channels. Additionally, SCBs are beneficial against other sodium and potassium channel-related neonatal seizures.

We report herein two neonates with intractable neonatal seizures with SCN2A pathogenic missense variants. Both infants showed temporary seizure relief following IV administrations of phenytoin, but were resistant to a combination of antiepileptic drugs, while complete seizure control was achieved following lacosamide administration. We suggest that SCBs, e.g. phenytoin, should be introduced early for refractory neonatal seizures of non-lesional and presumably genetic origin. If any beneficial response to a SCB is noted, this should prompt an initiation of additional SCBs.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) dynamics and muscle mass regulatory signaling were studied in GK rats, a model for type 2 diabetes (T2D). GK rats exhibited a number of features that are consistent with sarcopenia and T2D including loss of muscle mass and strength, in addition to glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired \u03b2-cell responsiveness to glucose. Mechanistically, activation levels of Akt, a key modulator of protein balance, were decreased in T2D. Consequently, we confirmed reduced activity of mTOR signaling components and higher expression of atrophy-related markers typified by FoxO1/atrogin-1/MuRF1 and myostatin-Smad2/3 signaling during the course of diabetes. We observed in GK rat reduced antioxidant capacity (\u2193GSH/GSSG) and increased expression and activity of NADPH oxidase in connection with augmented rate of oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA. H2S bioavailability and the expression of key enzymes involved in its synthesis were suppressed as a function of diabetes. Interestingly, GK rats receiving NaHS displayed increased muscle Akt/mTOR signaling and decreased expression of myostatin and the FoxO1/MuRF1/atrogin-dependent pathway. Moreover, diabetes-induced heightened state of oxidative stress was also ameliorated in response to NaHS therapy. Overall, the current data support the notion that a relationship exists between sarcopenia, heightened state of oxidative stress, and H2S deficiency at least in the context of diabetes. Moreover, treatment with a potent H2S donor at an early stage of diabetes is likely to mitigate the development of sarcopenia/frailty and predictably reduces its devastating sequelae of amputation.", "meta": {"pmid": 30510624}}

The aims of this study were to investigate the metabolism of cisapride in human liver microsomes and to determine which cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme(s) are involved in cisapride biotransformation. Additionally, the effects of various drugs on the metabolism of cisapride were investigated. The major in vitro metabolite of cisapride was formed by oxidative N-dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen, leading to the production of norcisapride. By using competitive inhibition data, correlation studies and heterologous expression systems, it was demonstrated that CYP3A4 was the major CYP involved. CYP2A6 also contributed to the metabolism of cisapride, albeit to a much lesser extent. The mean apparent K(m) against cisapride was 8.6+/-3.5 microM (n = 3). The peak plasma levels of cisapride under normal clinical practice are approximately 0.17 microM; therefore it is unlikely that cisapride would inhibit the metabolism of co-administered drugs. In this in vitro study the inhibitory effects of 44 drugs were tested for any effect on cisapride biotransformation. In conclusion, 34 of the drugs are unlikely to have a clinically relevant interaction; however, the antidepressant nefazodone, the macrolide antibiotic troleandomycin, the HIV-1 protease inhibitors ritonavir and indinavir and the calcium channel blocker mibefradil inhibited the metabolism of cisapride and these interactions are likely to be of clinical relevance.

Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed CIMP+ as an independent prognostic factor for both OS [hazard ratio (HR), 12.266; P = 0.015] and RFS (HR, 2.275; P = 0.032) in TNM stage I patients. CIMP+ may specifically define a subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome in TNM stage I HCC. Examination of CIMP status may be useful for stratifying prognosis of patients with early-stage HCC and identifying patients who are at higher risk for recurrence.", "meta": {"pmid": 20112070}}

In this study, dietary hypocholesterolaemic spices, garlic and onion (both raw or heat-processed) were examined for their antilithogenic potential by including at 0.6 and 2.0 % level, respectively, along with lithogenic (LG) diet for 10 weeks. Dietary garlic and onion reduced the CGS incidence by 15-39 %, the effect being maximum in the heat-processed onion group. Dietary garlic and onion markedly reduced biliary cholesterol. The cholesterol:phospholipid ratio which was 1.58 in the LG diet group was reduced to 0.73-0.96 in the garlic and onion groups. The biliary cholesterol saturation index was 0.92, 1.25, 1.09 and 0.86, respectively, in the heat-processed onion, raw garlic, heat-processed garlic and raw onion groups, while it was 1.9 in the LG group. The hydrophobicity index of bile was - 0.08, - 0.079, - 0.032 and - 0.073, respectively, in the heat-processed onion, raw garlic, heat-processed garlic and raw onion groups, while it was +0.054 in the LG group. Hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase activity was lowered in the LG diet-fed group, while dietary garlic or onion countered this alteration and also increased the activities of hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase. Serum and liver cholesterol were decreased by feeding garlic or onion compared to the LG diet. Thus, dietary Allium spices exerted antilithogenic influence by decreasing the cholesterol hyper-secretion into bile and increasing the bile acid output thus decreasing the formation of lithogenic bile in experimental mice.", "meta": {"pmid": 18983715}}

Recent genome-wide association studies have identified new variants outside of the MHC with relevance to the immunology of psoriasis. Variants in or near genes that encode subunits of cytokines (IL12B, IL23A) or cytokine receptors (IL23R) are interesting given that the gene product of IL12B, p40, is the target of a recently approved monoclonal antibody therapy for psoriasis (ustekinumab). Association with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has been found in TNFAIP3 and TNFIP1, ubiquitin ligases in the NF-kappaB pathway, and IL13, a Th2 cytokine.

{"text": "Protease inhibitors (PIs) are of central importance in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV NS3 protease (NS3P) position 80 displays polymorphisms associated with resistance to the PI simeprevir for HCV genotype 1a. We investigated the effects of position-80-substitutions on fitness and PI-resistance for HCV genotypes 1-6, and analyzed evolutionary mechanisms underlying viral escape mediated by pre-existing Q80K. The fitness of infectious NS3P recombinants of HCV genotypes 1-6, with engineered position-80-substitutions, was studied by comparison of viral spread kinetics in Huh-7.5 cells in culture. Median effective concentration (EC50) and fold resistance for PIs simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir were determined in short-term treatment assays. Viral escape was studied by long-term treatment of genotype 1a recombinants with simeprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir and of genotype 3a recombinants with glecaprevir and voxilaprevir, next generation sequencing, NS3P substitution linkage and haplotype analysis. Among tested PIs, only glecaprevir and voxilaprevir showed pan-genotypic activity against the original genotype 1-6 culture viruses. Variants with position-80-substitutions were all viable, but fitness depended on the specific substitution and the HCV isolate. Q80K conferred resistance to simeprevir across genotypes but had only minor effects on the activity of the remaining PIs. For genotype 1a, pre-existing Q80K mediated accelerated escape from simeprevir, grazoprevir and to a lesser extent glecaprevir, but not voxilaprevir. For genotype 3a, Q80K mediated accelerated escape from glecaprevir and voxilaprevir. Escape was mediated by rapid and genotype-, PI- and PI-concentration-dependent co-selection of clinically relevant resistance associated substitutions. Position-80-substitutions had relatively low fitness cost and the potential to promote HCV escape from clinically relevant PIs in vitro, despite having a minor impact on results in classical short-term resistance assays. Among all clinically relevant hepatitis C virus protease inhibitors, voxilaprevir and glecaprevir showed the highest and most uniform activity against cell culture infectious hepatitis C virus with genotype 1-6 proteases. Naturally occurring amino acid changes at protease position 80 had low fitness cost and influenced sensitivity to simeprevir, but not to other protease inhibitors in short-term treatment assays.

Phenotypic features of CHARGE are highly variable and incompletely penetrant. To explore developmental roles of CHD7, we generated mice carrying the Chd7(Gt) allele from a Chd7-deficient, gene-trapped lacZ reporter ES cell line. RT-PCR of embryo RNA demonstrated significantly reduced levels of wild-type transcript in Chd7(Gt/Gt) embryos. Chd7(Gt/Gt) embryos survive only up to embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Chd7(Gt/+) male and female mice are viable, small, and exhibit variable degrees of head-bobbing and circling, consistent with vestibular dysfunction. Paint-filling of E16.5 heterozygous inner ears revealed defects of the semicircular canals. The pattern of beta-galactosidase activity in Chd7(Gt/+) embryos mimics Chd7 mRNA expression in wild-type embryos, confirming the fidelity of the lacZ reporter. We observed tissue-specific beta-galactosidase in the E12.5 and E14.5 Chd7(Gt/+) brain, pituitary, ear, heart, and craniofacial structures, indicating survival of Chd7(Gt/+) cells in CHARGE-relevant organs.

{"text": "Many antidepressants inhibit serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake or both to achieve their clinical effect. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class of antidepressants (SSRIs) includes citalopram, escitalopram (active enantiomer of citalopram), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. The SSRIs are as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in treatment of major depression with less significant side effects. As a result, they have become the largest class of medications prescribed to humans for depression. They are also used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorders, alcoholism, obesity, migraines, and chronic pain. An SSRI (fluoxetine) has been approved for veterinary use in treatment of canine separation anxiety. SSRIs act specifically on synaptic serotonin concentrations by blocking its reuptake in the presynapse and increasing levels in the presynaptic membrane. Clinical signs of SSRI overdose result from excessive amounts of serotonin in the central nervous system. These signs include nausea, vomiting, mydriasis, hypersalivation, and hyperthermia. Clinical signs are dose dependent and higher dosages may result in the serotonin syndrome that manifests itself as ataxia, tremors, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, diarrhea, and seizures. Current studies reveal no increase in appearance of any specific clinical signs of serotonin toxicity with regard to any SSRI medication. In people, citalopram has been reported to have an increased risk of electrocardiographic abnormalities. Diagnosis of SSRI poisoning is based on history, clinical signs, and response to therapy. No single clinical test is currently available to confirm SSRI toxicosis. The goals of treatment in this intoxication are to support the animal, prevent further absorption of the drug, support the central nervous system, control hyperthermia, and halt any seizure activity. The relative safety of the SSRIs in overdose despite the occurrence of serotonin syndrome makes them more desirable than other antidepressants. The prognosis in animals that receive treatment is excellent. In one retrospective study, there were no deaths in 313 SSRI-poisoned dogs. No characteristic or classic histopathologic lesions result from SSRI toxicosis. Differential diagnoses for SSRI overdose must include ingestions of other serotonergic medications such as phenylpiperidine opioids (fentanyl and tramadol), mirtazapine, buspirone, amitraz, and chlorpheniramine.", "meta": {"pmid": 23796482}}
{"text": "The tripartite DENN module, comprised of a N-terminal longin domain, followed by DENN, and d-DENN domains, is a GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEFs) for Rab GTPases, which are regulators of practically all membrane trafficking events in eukaryotes. Using sequence and structure analysis we identify multiple novel homologs of the DENN module, many of which can be traced back to the ancestral eukaryote. These findings provide unexpected leads regarding key cellular processes such as autophagy, vesicle-vacuole interactions, chromosome segregation, and human disease. Of these, SMCR8, the folliculin interacting protein-1 and 2 (FNIP1 and FNIP2), nitrogen permease regulator 2 (NPR2), and NPR3 are proposed to function in recruiting Rab GTPases during different steps of autophagy, fusion of autophagosomes with the vacuole and regulation of cellular metabolism. Another novel DENN protein identified in this study is C9ORF72; expansions of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC in its first intron have been recently implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). While this mutation is proposed to cause a RNA-level defect, the identification of C9ORF72 as a potential DENN-type GEF raises the possibility that at least part of the pathology might relate to a specific Rab-dependent vesicular trafficking process, as has been observed in the case of some other neurological conditions with similar phenotypes. We present evidence that the longin domain, such as those found in the DENN module, are likely to have been ultimately derived from the related domains found in prokaryotic GTPase-activating proteins of MglA-like GTPases. Thus, the origin of the longin domains from this ancient GTPase-interacting domain, concomitant with the radiation of GTPases, especially of the Rab clade, played an important role in the dynamics of eukaryotic intracellular membrane systems.", "meta": {"pmid": 23248642}}
{"text": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have become the drugs of choice for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, one of the major concerns with these drugs is cost. In an attempt to develop a cost-effective treatment strategy for patients referred to our lipid clinic, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the lipid-lowering efficacy of the various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors alone or in combination with niacin or cholestyramine. Based on cholesterol-lowering efficacy estimates derived from a literature-based meta-analysis, we performed a population-based treat-to-target analysis. Fifty-six trials with 101 monotherapy cohorts and 20 trials with 31 combination-therapy cohorts (573 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Based on reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the most effective monotherapy was atorvastatin and the least effective monotherapy was fluvastatin. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing LDL-C than monotherapy with the respective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. However, on the basis of dollars spent per percentage of LDL-C reduction, combination therapy was frequently less cost-effective than monotherapy. In addition, combination therapy was associated with a higher rate of noncompliance and a greater risk of drug-drug interactions. As a result, we based our treat-to-target analysis on the use of monotherapy as first-line treatment, with combination therapy reserved for patients failing to achieve the target LDL-C levels of the US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (NCEP ATP-II) with monotherapy. In the population-based treat-to-target analysis, atorvastatin was the most cost-effective drug for high-risk patients (those with coronary heart disease [CHD]), whereas fluvastatin was the most cost-effective agent for low-risk patients (<2 risk factors for CHD) and moderate-risk patients (> or =2 risk factors for CHD). If 1 drug is chosen to treat all patients (i.e., in cases of formulary restriction), atorvastatin would be the most cost-effective agent. In adapting the findings on cholesterol-lowering efficacy from this analysis to our lipid clinic, we concluded that the most cost-effective treatment approach is to individualize the selection of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor based on both coronary risk and the LDL-C reduction required to achieve NCEP ATP-II goals. Based on our results, 2 agents--atorvastatin and fluvastatin--should be available on the formulary.", "meta": {"pmid": 10321422}}

Markers encoded by aberrantly expressed genes, including some previously associated with leukemia stem cells, were studied by flow cytometry in 240 patients with AML and in nonleukemic myeloblasts from 63 bone marrow samples. Twenty-two (CD9, CD18, CD25, CD32, CD44, CD47, CD52, CD54, CD59, CD64, CD68, CD86, CD93, CD96, CD97, CD99, CD123, CD200, CD300a/c, CD366, CD371, and CX3CR1) markers were aberrantly expressed in AML. Leukemia-associated profiles defined by these markers extended to immature CD34+CD38- AML cells; expression remained stable during treatment. The markers yielded MRD measurements matching those of standard methods in 208 samples from 52 patients undergoing chemotherapy and revealed otherwise undetectable MRD. They allowed MRD monitoring in 129 consecutive patients, yielding prognostically significant results. Using a machine-learning algorithm to reduce high-dimensional data sets to 2-dimensional data, the markers allowed a clear visualization of MRD and could detect 1 leukemic cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. The markers uncovered in this study allow universal and sensitive monitoring of MRD in AML.

Methods: The clinical data of a child with IRAK4 deficiency who was admitted to the Department of Neurology of Shenzhen Children's Hospital for several times from June 2019 to August 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Related literature up to January 2021 with the key words \"IRAK4 gene variation\", and \"interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 deficiency\" in PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, and CQVIP databases were searched. The clinical characteristics of this disease were summarized and analyzed. Results: The boy was 6 years of age and had recurrent respiratory tract infections. He was improved after antibiotic treatment. His clinical manifestation included Streptococcus pneumoniae meningoencephalitis, multiple sclerosis, invasive discitis and inflammatory bone destruction. Family-based whole exome sequencing showed that the boy had a homozygous frameshift variation in the IRAK4 gene, NM_016123.3:C.540del (p.Phe180leufs*26), and both parents were heterozygous. A total of 23 cases were reported in ten English articles. Together with this case, there were 24 cases, including 13 males and 11 females. The age of onset was 8 days to 7 years. The main manifestations were recurrent invasive bacterial infection, including 11 cases with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, 9 cases with Streptococcus pneumoniae and (or) Staphylococcus aureus septicemia, 1 case with Pseudomonas aeruginosa meningitis, 1 case of salmonella infection, and 1 case with Staphylococcus aureus skin abscess. Only 1 case had recurrent virus infection. There were 2 patients with autoimmune diseases, 1 with autoimmune encephalitis and the other one with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Among the 24 cases, 10 died (9 in infancy). Most of the surviving children were diagnosed early and received antibiotics preventively and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Their susceptibility to infection decreased year by year, and could be close to normal children at the age of 14 years. Among the 24 cases, 21 cases had homozygous variation of IRAK4 gene and 3 cases had complex heterozygous variation. There were 15 kinds of variation, including 9 kinds of frameshift variation, 4 kinds of nonsense variation and 2 kinds of missense variation. One candidate variation hotspot was c.877 c>T (3 cases).

As previously reported for a spontaneous mouse mutant showing a mutation in Eml1, we observe severe cortical heterotopia in the KO. We also observe abnormal progenitor cells in early corticogenesis, likely to be the origin of the defects. EML1 KO mice on the C57BL/6N genetic background also appear to present a wider phenotype than the original mouse mutant, showing additional brain anomalies, such as corpus callosum abnormalities.

Allosteric agonists have the potential to stabilize unique receptor conformations, which may in turn cause differential activation of signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we have investigated the signaling pathways activated by AC-42, its analog 77-LH-28-1 (1-[3-(4-butyl-1-piperidinyl)propyl]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone), and a range of orthosteric muscarinic agonists [oxotremorine-M (oxo-M), arecoline, and pilocarpine] in Chinese hamster ovary cells recombinantly expressing the human M(1) mACh receptor. Each agonist was able to activate Galpha(q/11)-dependent signaling, as demonstrated by an increase in guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding to Galpha(q/11) proteins and total [(3)H]inositol phosphate accumulation assays in intact cells. All three orthosteric agonists caused significant enhancements in [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to Galpha(i1/2) subunits over basal; however, neither allosteric ligand produced a significant response. In contrast, both orthosteric and allosteric agonists are able to couple to the Galpha(s)/cAMP pathway, enhancing forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation.

Here, we sought to investigate whether MSD can exacerbate gastrointestinal toxicity after local abdominal irradiation, an exposure regimen more relevant to clinical settings. Male CBA/CaJ mice fed either a methionine-adequate diet or MSD (6.5 mg methionine/kg diet vs 19.5 mg/kg) received localized abdominal X-irradiation (220 kV, 13 mA) using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform, and tissues were harvested 4, 7, and 10 days after irradiation. MSD exacerbated gastrointestinal toxicity after local abdominal irradiation with 12.5 Gy. This was evident as impaired nutrient absorption was paralleled by reduced body weight recovery. Mechanistically, significant shifts in the gut ecology, evident as decreased microbiome diversity, and substantially increased bacterial species that belong to the genus Bacteroides triggered proinflammatory responses.

Recently, three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), LPS1/GPR34, LPS2/P2Y10, and LPS3/GPR174, were found to react specifically with LysoPS, raising the possibility that LysoPS exerts its roles through these receptors. In this study, we show that LPS3 is expressed in various T cell subtypes and is involved in suppression of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in CD4 T cells. We found that LysoPS suppressed the IL-2 production from activated T cells at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, LysoPS did not have such an effect on the splenocytes and CD4 T cells isolated from LPS3-deficient mice. In LPS3-deficient splenocytes and CD4 T cells, anti-CD3/anti-CD28-triggered IL-2 production is somewhat increased. Interestingly, LysoPS with various fatty acids was up-regulated upon T cell activation. The present study raised the possibility that LysoPS exerts its immunosuppressive roles by down-regulating IL-2 production through a LysoPS-LPS3 axis in T cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 29017923}}
{"text": "We have recently reported the health beneficial potential of dietary garlic and onion in reducing the incidence and severity of cholesterol gallstone (CGS) during its experimental induction in mice. In the current study, the efficacy of dietary garlic and onion in regressing preestablished CGS was investigated in experimental mice. After inducing CGS in mice with a lithogenic diet for 10 weeks, they were maintained on basal diets containing 0.6% dehydrated garlic or 2% dehydrated onion for a further 10 weeks. Dietary garlic and onion, either raw or heat processed, regressed preformed CGS in mice up to 53% to 59%, whereas the regression in the basal control diet group was only 10%. The antilithogenic potency of garlic was decreased by its heat processing, but not in the case of onion. Biliary cholesterol was significantly decreased in garlic- and onion-fed animals. Biliary cholesterol saturation index and hydrophobicity index were significantly lowered by dietary garlic and onion. Serum and liver cholesterol levels were decreased by feeding these spices during post-CGS induction period. Hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity was increased after feeding garlic and onion, whereas activities of the cholesterol-degrading enzymes cholesterol-7\u03b1-hydroxylase and sterol-27-hydroxylase were increased in spice-fed groups. These results indicate that feeding garlic and onion effectively accelerates the regression of preformed CGS by promoting cholesterol desaturation in bile. This observation is significant in the context of evolving dietary intervention strategy to address regression of existing CGS and stopping the possible recurrence.", "meta": {"pmid": 20153000}}

By microarray expression analysis (Affymetrix HU133A) important players in the noradrenalin biosynthesis pathway (DBH, DDC, GATA2, GATA3, PHOX2A, PHOX2B, SLC6A2 SLC18A1 and TH) were found to be among the top ranked genes in showing lower expression in unfavorable NB tumor types as compared to favorable ones. By quantitative PCR with TaqMan, this result was significantly verified for all transcripts (p<0.05, one-tailed) in a new set of 11 primary NB tumors (5 favorable vs. 6 unfavorable). PHOX2A, a downstream target of Phox2b, was found to be the sixth ranked gene from the microarray gene list. Since the PHOX2A gene is localized in a tumor suppressor candidate region at 11q, we screened this gene for mutations by DNA sequencing in 47 tumors of different stages. However, no critical changes were found that could support its role in tumor development or progression. Overall, the findings in this study either suggest that expression of this pathway could be a predictive differentiation marker of NB tumors, or our results could also imply that the noradrenalin biosynthesis pathway is involved in tumor pathogenesis.", "meta": {"pmid": 19212675}}

We evaluated the combination of 3-AP plus gemcitabine in advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma. Thirty-three patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder or biliary tract received gemcitabine (1,000\u00a0mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28\u00a0days) 1\u00a0h after completing a 4-h infusion of 3-AP given at a dose of 105\u00a0mg/m(2) in patients with normal liver function (stratum A) or 80\u00a0mg/m(2) if abnormal liver function (stratum B). The trial was designed to determine whether the response rate was at least 30% in stratum A and 20% in stratum B. Objective response occurred in 3 of 23 patients (13%, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 3, 34%) with normal liver function, and in 0 of 10 patients with abnormal liver function.

{"text": "The role of central histamine in amygdaloid kindled seizures in rats was studied. Histamine content in the amygdala was significantly decreased after development of amygdaloid kindling. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of histamine resulted in inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures. The H1-agonists 2-methylhistamine and 2-thiazolylethylamine also inhibited amygdaloid kindled seizures. In addition, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of histidine and metoprine inhibited amygdaloid kindled seizures at doses that caused increases in histamine contents of the brain. H1-antagonists (diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine) attenuated histamine- or histidine-induced inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures. Both i.c.v. and i.p. injections of H3-antagonists (thioperamide, AQ0145 and clobenpropit) resulted in a dose-related inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures. The effects of thioperamide and AQ0145 were inhibited by an H3-agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine and H1-antagonists. On the other hand, H2-antagonists showed no antagonistic effect. GABAmimetic drugs, diazepam, sodium valproate and muscimol potentiated the effect of clobenpropit. Bicuculline caused significant antagonism of the inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures induced by clobenpropit. These findings suggested that a histaminergic mechanism plays an important role in suppressing amygdaloid kindled seizures through histamine H1-receptors. In addition, an inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures induced by histamine is closely related with the action of GABA.", "meta": {"pmid": 11411342}}

{"text": "Background: Surfactant protein D (SFTPD) is a lung specific protein which performs several key regulatory processes to maintain overall lung function. Several infectious and immune mediated diseases have been shown to be associated with SFTPD. Recent findings have suggested the serum concentration of SFTPD can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute exacerbation COPD (AECOPD). But these findings lack replication studies from different ethnic populations and meta-analysis, to establish SFTPD as reliable diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for COPD and associated conditions. Methods: We performed systematic literature search based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify eligible studies to perform a meta-analysis. Our objective was to assess the predictability of serum SFTPD concentration and SFTPD allelic conformation at rs721917 (C > T) with COPD and AECOPD outcome. These variables were compared between COPD and healthy controls, where mean difference (MD), and odds ratio (OR) were calculated to predict the overall effect size. Review manager (RevMan-v5.3) software was used to analyse the data. Results: A total of eight published reports were included in this study. Comparative serum SFTPD concentration data were extracted from six studies and three studies were evaluated for assessment of genetic marker from SFTPD. Our study identified strong association of elevated serum SFTPD with COPD and AECOPD. Significant association of risk was also observed for \"T\" allele or \"TT\" genotype of rs721917 from SFTPD with COPD and AECOPD.

DNA of the propositus was screened for mutations by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis in all known candidate genes for MED, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and the COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3 genes coding for the alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 chains of collagen IX. The screening identified a unique change in PCR products of exon 3 of the COL9A3 gene. Sequencing indicated a G to A mutation in the acceptor splice site (G(-1)IVS2-->A) of intron 2 in all affected relatives, but not in unaffected relatives. Analysis of RNA from the propositus indicated a skipping of exon 3, and thus, a deletion of 12 amino acid residues as a consequence of the mutation.

First and second-generation (with E4-deletion) adenoviruses encoding the HCV5'NCR in antisense direction (Ad-NCRas and Ad-E4del-NCRas) were generated. Inhibition of HCV gene expression was analyzed in hepatoma cells stably transfected with the HCV5'NCR cDNA fused to the firefly luciferase gene (NCRluc), as well as in the HCV subgenomic replicon (genotypes 1b and 2a) and the fully infectious HCV JFH-1 cell culture systems. For in vivo experiments, an adenovirus encoding the NCRluc-gene was injected intravenously to achieve a NCR-dependent luciferase-expression in the liver of C3H/HeNcrl-mice. Forty eight hours after transduction with GFP-encoding adenoviruses, >85% of HepG2-, CCL13-and Huh7-cells expressed GFP. Surprisingly, GFP-expression of E4-deleted adenoviruses was considerably reduced at the same MOI. Using antisense first-generation adenoviruses (Ad-NCRas), a significant inhibition of the 5'NCR-dependent HCV-gene expression (54\u00b119% in HepG2-cells and 66.2\u00b115% in Huh7-cells) was achieved 48h after transduction. In Huh7-cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicons and in infectious HCV JFH-1 cell cultures, adenovirus-mediated transcription of antisense 5'NCR significantly blocked HCV-replication (40% and 76%, respectively). Corresponding to low transgene expression, the maximal inhibition reached with Ad-delE4-NCRas was 30%.

Fibroblasts isolated from keloid tissue and normal skin tissues were treated with asiaticoside at different concentrations. Afterwards, they were subjected to RT-PCR and Western blot analyses.

Here, we use the spared nerve injury model (SNI), to evaluate the influence of Rgs9-2 in sensory symptoms, as well as in anxiety and depression-like behaviors observed under neuropathic pain conditions. Our data demonstrate that knockout of the Rgs9 gene reduces the intensity of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia the first few days after nerve injury.

Furthermore, Rgs9-2 deletion exacerbates anxiety and depression like behaviors several weeks after the emergence of the neuropathic pain symptoms. Our findings also reveal a temporal and regional regulation of Rgs9-2 protein expression by neuropathic pain, as Rgs9-2 levels are reduced in the spinal cord a few days after nerve injury, whereas decreased Rgs9-2 levels in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) are only observed several weeks after nerve injury.

The enzymes involved in the maturation of lamin A present a challenge to this paradigm. Lamin A is first synthesized as a 74-kDa precursor, prelamin A, with a C-terminal CaaX motif and undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications including CaaX processing (farnesylation, aaX cleavage and carboxylmethylation), followed by endoproteolytic cleavage by Zmpste24. Failure to cleave prelamin A results in progeria and related premature aging disorders. Evidence suggests prelamin A is imported directly into the nucleus where it is processed. Paradoxically, the processing enzymes have been shown to reside in the cytosol (farnesyltransferase), or are ER membrane proteins (Zmpste24, Rce1, and Icmt) with their active sites facing the cytosol. Here we have reexamined the cellular site of prelamin A processing, and show that the mammalian and yeast processing enzymes Zmpste24 and Icmt exhibit a dual localization to the inner nuclear membrane, as well as the ER membrane.

These diseases are generally due to single gene defects and follow Mendelian inheritance.We collected 51 DNA samples from Miniature Schnauzers affected by PRA (average age of diagnosis \u223c3.9 \u00b11 years), as well as from 56 clinically normal controls of the same breed (average age \u223c6.6 \u00b12.8 years). Pedigree analysis suggested monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance of PRA. GWAS and homozygosity mapping defined a critical interval in the first 4,796,806 bp of CFA15. Whole genome sequencing of two affected cases, a carrier and a control identified two candidate variants within the critical interval. One was an intronic SNV in HIVEP3, and the other was a complex structural variant consisting of the duplication of exon 5 of the PPT1 gene along with a conversion and insertion (named PPT1dci ). PPT1dci was confirmed homozygous in a cohort of 22 cases, and 12 more cases were homozygous for the CFA15 haplotype. Additionally, the variant was found homozygous in 6 non-affected dogs of age higher than the average age of onset. The HIVEP3 variant was found heterozygous (n = 4) and homozygous wild-type (n = 1) in cases either homozygous for PPT1dci or for the mapped CFA15 haplotype. We detected the wildtype and three aberrant PPT1 transcripts in isolated white blood cell mRNA extracted from a PRA case homozygous for PPT1dci , and the aberrant transcripts involved inclusion of the duplicated exon 5 and novel exons following the activation of cryptic splice sites. No neurological signs were detected among the dogs homozygous for the PPT1dci variant. Therefore, we propose PPT1dci as causative for a non-syndromic form of PRA (PRA PPT1 ) that shows incomplete penetrance in Miniature Schnauzers, potentially related to the presence of the wild-type transcript.

In this study, we hypothesized that Sorbs2 plays an important role in regulating cardiac ion channel expression and function. Using electrophysiological and molecular biological approaches, we found that the Sorbs2 knockout (KO) mice progressively developed cardiac structural and electrical remodeling as early as 1 to 2\u00a0months of age and died prematurely at 5 to 7\u00a0months of age. Electrocardiographic recordings showed that Sorbs2 KO mice had conduction delays, spontaneous ventricular extrasystoles and polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Intracellular recordings revealed abnormal action potentials with depolarized resting potential, reduced upstroke velocity, prolonged repolarization, and effective refractory period in the ventricular preparations of Sorbs2 KO mice. Patch clamp experiments demonstrated that Sorbs2 KO mice displayed distinct abnormalities in the expression and function of cardiac ion channels, including those of the voltage-gated Na+ channels, L-type Ca2+ channels, the voltage-gated K+ channels and the inward-rectifier K+ channels. Moreover, Sorbs2 physically interacted with the RNAs and/or proteins of important cardiac ion channels and directly regulated their expression in vitro.

In the cohort study, the incidence of zoster was higher in patients with CD and UC compared with their matched controls (UC incidence rate ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.40; CD incidence rate ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35-1.92). In the nested case-control study, receipt of a prescription for corticosteroids (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2) or azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.6) were both associated with zoster. Patients with IBD, especially those on immunosuppressive medications, are at higher risk for herpes zoster compared with the general population.

{"text": "Skin wound healing is a complex process requiring the coordinated behavior of many cell types, especially in the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a member of the FGF family that promotes fibroblast migration, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present RNA sequencing study showed that the expression levels of several canonical Wnt pathway genes, including Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt11, T-cell factor 7 (TCF7), and Frizzled 8 (FZD8) were modified by bFGF stimulation in fibroblasts. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis also showed that Wnt pathway was activated under bFGF treatment. Furthermore, treatment of fibroblasts with lithium chloride or IWR-1, an inducer and inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, respectively, promoted and inhibited cell migration. Also, levels of cytosolic glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta phosphorylated at serine9 (pGSK3\u03b2 Ser9) and nuclear \u03b2-catenin were increased upon exposure to bFGF. Molecular and biochemical assays indicated that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activated the GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway via activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), suggesting that PI3K and JNK act at the upstream of \u03b2-catenin. In contrast, knock-down of \u03b2-catenin delayed fibroblast cell migration even under bFGF stimulation. RNA sequencing analysis of \u03b2-catenin knock-down fibroblasts demonstrated that \u03b2-catenin positively regulated the transcription of bFGF and FGF21. Moreover, FGF21 treatment activated AKT and JNK, and accelerated fibroblast migration to a similar extent as bFGF does. In addition, ELISA analysis demonstrated that both of bFGF and FGF21 were auto secretion factor and be regulated by Wnt pathway stimulators. Taken together, our analyses define a feedback regulatory loop between bFGF (FGF21) and Wnt signaling acting through \u03b2-catenin in skin fibroblasts.", "meta": {"pmid": 28217097}}

Individual factors that predispose for a person's vitamin D status, such as skin type, have been identified, but limited data exist on genetic determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration. We have tested the hypothesis that variants of genes (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) involved in skin pigmentation are predictive of serum 25(OH)D levels. Serum 25(OH)D and SNPs (n = 960) related to genes with relevance for skin pigmentation (tyrosinase [TYR], TYR-related protein 1 [TYRP1], dopachrome tautomerase [DCT], oculocutaneous albinism II [OCA2], two pore segment channel 2 [TPCN2], solute carrier family 24 A4 [SLC24A4], solute carrier family 45 A2 [SLC45A2], agouti signalling peptide [ASIP], cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor [ATF1], microphthalmia-associated transcription factor [MITF], proopiomelanocortin [POMC], cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit beta [PRKACB], cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gamma [PRKACG], cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I-alpha regulatory subunit [PRKAR1A], cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-alpha regulatory subunit [PRKAR2A], cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit [PRKAR2B], tubulin beta-3 chain/melanocortin receptor 1 [TUBB3/MC1R], Cadherin-1 [CDH1], catenin beta 1 [CTNNB1], Endothelin 1 [EDN1], endothelin 3 [EDN3], endothelin receptor type B [EDNRB], fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2], KIT, KIT ligand [KITLG], nerve growth factor [NGF], interferon regulatory factor 4 [IRF4], exocyst complex component 2 [EXOC2], and tumor protein 53 [TP53]) were analyzed in a cohort of participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study (n = 2970). A total of 46 SNPs were associated (P <.05) with lower or higher serum 25(OH)D levels as compared with the total cohort (median, 15.5 ng/mL). Although 1 SNP in the EXOC2 gene reached the aimed significance level after correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate) and was associated with a \u039425(OH)D value more than 5.00 ng/mL, 11 SNPs located in the TYR (n = 4), PRKACG (n = 1), EDN1 (n = 3), TYRP1 (n = 1), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (n = 2) genes reached the aimed significance level after false discovery rate correction but were not associated with \u039425(OH)D value more than 5.00 ng/mL.

{"text": "Hypusine is formed post-translationally from lysine and is found in a single cellular protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5A (eIF5A), and its homolog eIF5A2. Biosynthesis of hypusine is a two-step reaction involving the enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH). eIF5A is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and plays a role in mRNA translation, cellular proliferation, cellular differentiation, and inflammation. DHPS is also highly conserved and is essential for life, as Dhps-null mice are embryonic lethal. Using exome sequencing, we identified rare biallelic, recurrent, predicted likely pathogenic variants in DHPS segregating with disease in five affected individuals from four unrelated families. These individuals have similar neurodevelopmental features that include global developmental delay and seizures. Two of four affected females have short stature. All five affected individuals share a recurrent missense variant (c.518A>G [p.Asn173Ser]) in trans with a likely gene disrupting variant (c.1014+1G>A, c.912_917delTTACAT [p.Tyr305_Ile306del], or c.1A>G [p.Met1?]). cDNA studies demonstrated that the c.1014+1G>A variant causes aberrant splicing. Recombinant DHPS enzyme harboring either the p.Asn173Ser or p.Tyr305_Ile306del variant showed reduced (20%) or absent in\u00a0vitro activity, respectively. We co-transfected constructs overexpressing HA-tagged DHPS (wild-type or mutant) and GFP-tagged eIF5A into HEK293T cells to determine the effect of these variants on hypusine biosynthesis and observed that the p.Tyr305_Ile306del and p.Asn173Ser variants resulted in reduced hypusination of eIF5A compared to wild-type DHPS enzyme. Our data suggest that rare biallelic variants in DHPS result in reduced enzyme activity that limits the hypusination of eIF5A and are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder.", "meta": {"pmid": 30661771}}
{"text": "Transepithelial bicarbonate secretion by human airway submucosal glands and surface epithelial cells is crucial to maintain the pH-sensitive innate defence mechanisms of the lung. cAMP agonists stimulate HCO3- secretion via coordinated increases in basolateral HCO3- influx and accumulation, as well as CFTR-dependent HCO3- efflux at the luminal membrane of airway epithelial cells. Here, we investigated the regulation of a basolateral located, DIDS-sensitive, Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, anion exchanger 2 (AE2; SLC4A2) which is postulated to act as an acid loader, and therefore potential regulator of HCO3- secretion, in human airway epithelial cells. Using intracellular pH measurements performed on Calu-3 cells, we demonstrate that the activity of the basolateral Cl-/HCO3- exchanger was significantly downregulated by cAMP agonists, via a PKA-independent mechanism and also required Ca2+ and calmodulin under resting conditions. AE2 contains potential phosphorylation sites by a calmodulin substrate, protein kinase CK2, and we demonstrated that AE2 activity was reduced in the presence of CK2 inhibition. Moreover, CK2 inhibition abolished the activity of AE2 in primary human nasal epithelia. Studies performed on mouse AE2 transfected into HEK-293T cells confirmed almost identical Ca2+/calmodulin and CK2 regulation to that observed in Calu-3 and primary human nasal cells. Furthermore, mouse AE2 activity was reduced by genetic knockout of CK2, an effect which was rescued by exogenous CK2 expression. Together, these findings are the first to demonstrate that CK2 is a key regulator of Cl--dependent HCO3- export at the serosal membrane of human airway epithelial cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 28455748}}
{"text": "Lens development is regulated by a variety of transcription factors with distinct properties. The lens-specific transcription factor, L-Maf, is essential for lens formation and induces lens-specific markers, such as the crystallin genes. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which L-Maf regulates delta-crystallin expression. Misexpression of L-Maf in the head ectoderm of lens placode-forming embryos by in ovo electroporation induced delta-crystallin only in the region surrounding the lens. To define this restricted expression, we misexpressed L-Maf together with other transcription factors implicated in delta-crystallin expression. Sox2 plus L-Maf expanded the delta-crystallin-inducible domain to the entire head ectoderm and simultaneously increased the quantity of delta-crystallin mRNA expressed. In contrast, co-expression of L-Maf with other factors such as Pax6, Six3 and Prox1 had little or no effect on delta-crystallin. We also observed that L-Maf and Sox2 cooperatively enhanced the transactivation of a reporter gene bearing the delta-crystallin enhancer in ovo, implying that L-Maf and Sox2 can induce delta-crystallin through the same enhancer. In conclusion, we report here that L-Maf and Sox2 cooperatively regulate the expression of delta-crystallin during chick lens development.", "meta": {"pmid": 12676323}}

Because other gastrointestinal prokinetic agents, such as cisapride and erythromycin, cause slowing of cardiac repolarization and have been implicated in the development of the potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia, torsades de pointes, a study was initiated to determine whether tegaserod and its main human metabolite adversely influence cardiac repolarization. By using isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, we show that QT intervals remain unchanged at concentrations of tegaserod from 0.5 to 10 microM. It was not until the tegaserod concentration was increased to 50 microM (roughly 500-5,000 times more concentrated than those typically found in human plasma after administration of recommended clinical dosages), that a small, but significant increase in the QT interval (12+/-4%; p < 0.05; n = 4) was observed. No significant changes in QT occurred in the presence of the tegaserod metabolite at any of the concentrations tested (0.5-50 microM). In contrast, cisapride caused QT lengthening at concentrations as low as 0.1 microM, with significant QT increases occurring when 5-50 microM cisapride was used (22+/-4% to >70%, respectively; p < 0.01; n = 4). Erythromycin also caused significant lengthening of QT intervals (11+/-2%; p < 0.001; n = 4), although 100 microM concentrations of this drug were required to achieve this effect. These results demonstrate that both cisapride and erythromycin can slow cardiac repolarization at therapeutic doses and that tegaserod's lack of QT prolongation at therapeutic doses suggests that it has the potential to be a safer alternative to cisapride as a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent.", "meta": {"pmid": 10413072}}

They can cause erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory disorders, and in both sexes orgasmic and arousal disorders. Among the drugs whose mechanism is primordial are the neuroleptics firstly, among antalgics tramadol and strong opioid agonists are also potentially deleterious to different degrees on sexual function.

{"text": "Pneumococcal meningitis is a life-threatening disease characterized by an acute purulent infection affecting the pia mater, the arachnoid, and the subarachnoid spaces. Streptococcus pneumoniae crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by both transcellular traversal and disruption of the intraepithelial tight junctions to allow intercellular traversal. During multiplication, pneumococci release their bacterial products, which are highly immunogenic and may lead to an increased inflammatory response in the host. Thus, these compounds are recognized by antigen-presenting cells through the binding of toll-like receptors. These receptors induce the activation of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), which interacts with various protein kinases, including IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK4), which is phosphorylated and dissociated from MyD88. These products also interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 dependent signaling pathway (TRAF6). This cascade provides a link to NF- \u03ba B-inducing kinase, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF- \u03ba B leading to the production of cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory molecules in response to bacterial stimuli. Consequently, polymorphonuclear cells are attracted from the bloodstream and then activated, releasing large amounts of NO(\u2022), O2(\u2022), and H2O2. This formation generates oxidative and nitrosative stress, subsequently, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, and BBB breakdown, which contributes to cell injury during pneumococcal meningitis.", "meta": {"pmid": 23766853}}

The PKC\u03b9 gene PRKCI is targeted for frequent tumor-specific copy number gain (CNG) in both lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC). We recently demonstrated that in LSCC cells PRKCI CNG functions to drive transformed growth and tumorigenicity by activating PKC\u03b9-dependent cell autonomous Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Here, we assessed whether OSC cells harboring PRKCI CNG exhibit similar PKC\u03b9-dependent Hh signaling. Surprisingly, we find that whereas PKC\u03b9 is required for the transformed growth of OSC cells harboring PRKCI CNG, these cells do not exhibit PKC\u03b9-dependent Hh signaling or Hh-dependent proliferation. Rather, transformed growth of OSC cells is regulated by PKC\u03b9-dependent nuclear localization of the oncogenic transcription factor, YAP1. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of PKC\u03b9 leads to decreased nuclear YAP1 and increased YAP1 binding to angiomotin (AMOT), which sequesters YAP1 in the cytoplasm. Biochemical analysis reveals that PKC\u03b9 directly phosphorylates AMOT at a unique site, Thr750, whose phosphorylation inhibits YAP1 binding. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKC\u03b9 decreases YAP1 nuclear localization and blocks OSC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

We have previously shown that, unlike glucose-addicted cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-transformed cells depend on glutamine rather than glucose for energy production and amino acid and nucleotide syntheses. High-level consumption of glutamine is tightly regulated and often coupled with the citrulline-nitric oxide (NO) cycle.

KSHV utilizes multiple microRNAs to upregulate ASS1 expression. Depletion of either ASS1 or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in KSHV-transformed cells suppresses growth proliferation, abolishes colony formation in soft agar, and decreases NO generation. Furthermore, by maintaining intracellular NO levels, ASS1 expression facilitates KSHV-mediated activation of the STAT3 pathway, which is critical for virus-induced transformation.

Notably, both TIEG1 and JARID1B are downregulated in melanomas, suggesting that they indeed cooperate physiologically. In conclusion, JARID1B is the first TIEG1 corepressor identified, explaining how TIEG1 represses transcription through inducing histone H3 lysine 4 demethylation, which may be important for TIEG1 function in both normal and cancer cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 20863814}}
{"text": "Antiandrogens are effective therapies that block androgen receptor (AR) transactivation and signaling in over 50% of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. However, an estimated 30% of responders will develop resistance to these therapies within 2 years. JNJ-pan-AR is a broad-spectrum AR antagonist that inhibits wild-type AR as well as several mutated versions of AR that have emerged in patients on chronic antiandrogen treatment. In this work, we aimed to identify the potential underlying mechanisms of resistance that may result from chronic JNJ-pan-AR treatment. The LNCaP JNJR prostate cancer subline was developed by chronically exposing LNCaP parental cells to JNJ-pan-AR. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling was performed to identify potential drivers and/or biomarkers of the resistant phenotype. Several enzymes critical to intratumoral androgen biosynthesis, Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), UGT2B15, and UGT2B17 were identified as potential upstream regulators of the JNJ-pan-AR resistant cells. While we confirmed the overexpression of all three enzymes in the resistant cells only AKR1C3 expression played a functional role in driving JNJ-pan-AR resistance. We also discovered that AKR1C3 regulates UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression in JNJ-pan-AR resistant cells. This study supports the rationale to further investigate the benefits of AKR1C3 inhibition in combination with antiandrogens to prevent CRPC disease progression.", "meta": {"pmid": 33258507}}
{"text": "USF1 (upstream stimulatory factor 1) is a transcription factor associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease in humans. However, whether USF1 is beneficial or detrimental to cardiometabolic health has not been addressed. By inactivating USF1 in mice, we demonstrate protection against diet-induced dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and atherosclerosis. The favorable plasma lipid profile, including increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased triglycerides, was coupled with increased energy expenditure due to activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Usf1 inactivation directs triglycerides from the circulation to BAT for combustion via a lipoprotein lipase-dependent mechanism, thus enhancing plasma triglyceride clearance. Mice lacking Usf1 displayed increased BAT-facilitated, diet-induced thermogenesis with up-regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, as well as increased BAT activity even at thermoneutrality and after BAT sympathectomy. A direct effect of USF1 on BAT activation was demonstrated by an amplified adrenergic response in brown adipocytes after Usf1 silencing, and by augmented norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis in mice lacking Usf1. In humans, individuals carrying SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) alleles that reduced USF1 mRNA expression also displayed a beneficial cardiometabolic profile, featuring improved insulin sensitivity, a favorable lipid profile, and reduced atherosclerosis. Our findings identify a new molecular link between lipid metabolism and energy expenditure, and point to the potential of USF1 as a therapeutic target for cardiometabolic disease.

However, the mechanisms by which ALC1 is regulated remain unclear. Here we report the crystal structure of human ALC1 and the cryoEM structure bound to the nucleosome. The structure shows the macro domain of ALC1 binds to lobe 2 of the ATPase motor, sequestering two elements for nucleosome recognition, explaining the autoinhibition mechanism of the enzyme. The H4 tail competes with the macro domain for lobe 2-binding, explaining the requirement for this nucleosomal epitope for ALC1 activation. A dual-arginine-anchor motif of ALC1 recognizes the acidic pocket of the nucleosome, which is critical for chromatin remodeling in vitro. Together, our findings illustrate the structures of ALC1 and shed light on its regulation mechanisms, paving the way for the discovery of drugs targeting ALC1 for the treatment of cancer.", "meta": {"pmid": 34210977}}

After a washout period of at least 4 weeks, participants were crossed over to receive the opposite injection. Both the investigators and participants were blinded to the order of injections. The participants completed the Singing Voice Handicap Index-10 (SVHI-10), the Voice Fatigue Index (VFI), and the Evaluation of the Ability to Sing Easily (EASE) before each injection and at intervals of 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week after the injection. The primary time point assessment was 72 hours after injection, and the SVHI-10 score was the primary outcome measure. Twenty singers (10 men; median age, 22 years [range, 19-42 years]) were enrolled. The improvements after either placebo or vitamin B12 injections were comparable to each other. At 72 hours after the vitamin B12 injection, the median difference in the SVHI-10 score was 1 (95% CI, -1 to 2) compared with 3 (95% CI, 0-4) after placebo. The median difference between differences at 72 hours between placebo and vitamin B12 injections were 1.5 (95% CI, -2 to 5) for the SVHI-10, 1 (95% CI, -9 to 9) for the VFI, and -1 (95% CI, -3 to 2) for the EASE.

The broad functional capacity of DARPP-32 has potential relevance to both psychotic and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We wished to determine if DARPP-32 gene expression and variation at selected SNPs correlated significantly with patient phenotypes. We performed RT-PCR to quantify DARPP-32 mRNA from brain samples (Brodmann Area 46) donated by the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI, Array Collection): 35 from unaffected controls (UC), 35 from patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), and 35 with bipolar disorder (BP). Relative mRNA expression was calculated in relation to the housekeeping gene Cyclophilin. SNP genotyping was conducted by PCR on DNA obtained from Brodmann Area 46. We found a significant difference in gene expression levels between SCZ patients who died by suicide (SCZ-S) (n=6) vs. other causes of death (SCZ-NS) (P<0.004), as well as between SCZ-S and UC (P<0.04).

{"text": "Acute stressors induce changes in numerous behavioral parameters through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Several important hormones in paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) play the roles in these stress-induced reactions. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and corticosterone are considered as molecular markers for stress-induced grooming behavior. Oxytocin in PVN is an essential modulator for stress-induced antinociception. The clock gene, Per1, has been identified as an effecter response to the acute stresses, but its function in neuroendocrine stress systems remains unclear. In the present study we observed the alterations in grooming and nociceptive behaviors induced by acute immobilization stress in Per1 mutant mice and other genotypes (wild types and Per2 mutant). The results displayed that stress elicited a more robust effect on grooming behavior in Per1 mutant mice than in other genotypes. Subsequently, the obvious stress-induced antinociception was observed in the wild-type and Per2 mutant mice, however, in Per1 mutant, this antinociceptive effects were partially-reversed (mechanical sensitivity), or over-reversed to hyperalgesia (thermal sensitivity). The real-time qPCR results showed that in PVN, there were stress-induced up-regulations of Crh, Avp and c-fos in all of genotypes; moreover, the expression change of Crh in Per1 mutant mice was much larger than in others. Another hormonal gene, Oxt, was up-regulated induced by stress in wild-type and Per2 mutant but not in Per1 mutant. In addition, the stress significantly elevated the serum corticosterone levels without genotype-dependent differences, and accordingly the glucocorticoid receptor gene, Nr3c1, expressed with a similar pattern in PVN of all strains. Taken together, the present study indicated that in acute stress treated Per1 mutant mice, there are abnormal hormonal responses in PVN, correlating with the aberrant performance of stress-induced behaviors. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel functional role of Per1 in neuroendocrine stress system, which further participates in analgesic regulation.", "meta": {"pmid": 21264262}}

We determined gene expression of ABC and SLC transporters in murine mammary tissue of different gestation and lactation stages, in murine mammary cells (HC11) featuring resting and secreting phenotypes and in bovine mammary tissue and cells (BME-UV). Effects on transporter expression and function of the imidazole fungicide prochloraz, previously reported to influence BCRP in mammary cells, was investigated on transporter expression and function in the two cell lines. Transporters studied were BCRP, MDR1, MRP1, OATP1A5/OATP1A2, OCTN1 and OCT1. Gene expressions of BCRP and OCT1 in murine mammary glands were increased during gestation and lactation, whereas MDR1, MRP1, OATP1A5 and OCTN1 were decreased, compared to expressions in virgins. All transporters measured in mammary glands of mice were detected in bovine mammary tissue and in HC11 cells, while only MDR1 and MRP1 were detected in BME-UV cells. Prochloraz treatment induced MDR1 gene and protein expression in both differentiated HC11 and BME-UV cells and increased protein function in HC11 cells, resulting in decreased accumulation of the MDR1 substrate digoxin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that murine (HC11) and bovine (BME-UV) mammary epithelial cells can be applied to characterize expression and function of transporters as well as effects of contaminants on the mammary transporters. An altered expression, induced by a drug or toxic chemical, on any of the transporters expressed in the mammary epithelial cells during lactation may modulate the well-balanced composition of nutrients and/or secretion of contaminants in milk with potential adverse effects on breast-fed infants and dairy consumers.

Data from the phase 3 RA-BEGIN study were analysed post hoc. Proportions of patients with structural damage progression (change from baseline greater than the smallest detectable change in modified total Sharp score) at week 52 were evaluated based on sustained Disease Activity Score for 28-joint count with serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (DAS28-hsCRP) \u2264\u20093.2 or Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) score \u2264\u200911; no formal statistical comparisons between treatments were performed to test these proportions. Baseline factors associated with risk of structural damage progression, including Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score, were identified using multivariate analysis. Patients achieving versus not achieving sustained DAS28-hsCRP \u2264\u20093.2 or SDAI score \u2264\u200911 were less likely to experience structural damage progression at week 52. In patients achieving these responses, structural damage progression was less likely with baricitinib monotherapy or plus MTX than with MTX monotherapy. In patients not achieving these sustained clinical thresholds, structural damage progression was less likely with baricitinib plus MTX than with either monotherapy. Independent of treatment, baseline factors significantly associated with increased risk of structural damage progression included higher hsCRP and CDAI score, smoking, female sex, and lower body mass index. In conclusion, patients achieving versus not achieving sustained DAS28-hsCRP \u2264\u20093.2 or SDAI score \u2264\u200911 were less likely to show structural damage progression, irrespective of treatment.", "meta": {"pmid": 30078086}}

In April 2013 the FDA approved the delayed-release combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride (Diclegis\u00ae) for NVP, based in part, on the results of a phase III randomized trial demonstrating the efficacy of this drug combination [study drug marketed under the trade name Diclectin\u00ae in Canada and Diclegis\u00ae in the United States] compared to placebo in pregnant women. Study drug dosing occurred for 14\u00a0days, which is substantially longer than what has been performed in similar studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate, through secondary analysis, whether the primary measure of efficacy can be demonstrated after five days of treatment. Women suffering from NVP were randomized to receive Diclegis\u00ae (n\u2009=\u2009131) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009125) for 14\u00a0days at doses ranging from two to four tablets a day, based on a pre-specified titration protocol. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the validated Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score at baseline versus Day 15 between Diclegis\u00ae-treated and placebo-treated women. For the present study, the change in PUQE score between baseline and Day 15 (end of the study) was compared to the changes observed for Days 3, 4, and 5. The use of delayed-release doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets show improved NVP symptom control as compared to placebo on Days 3,4 and 5, with sustained efficacy until the end of the trial. A four day study drug dosing trial with Diclegis\u00ae is sufficient to document efficacy, as the results are similar to those achieved after 14 study drug dosing days.

We characterized functional interactions of GR and GRIP1 in a repression complex where GR tethers to DNA-bound activator protein-1 (AP-1), as at the human collagenase-3 gene, and tested whether the identified interactions were similar or different at other response elements. At the AP-1 tethering GRE, we mapped the GRIP1 corepressor activity to a domain distinct from the two known GRIP1 activation domains; it exhibited intrinsic GR-independent repression potential when recruited to DNA via Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, neither the domain nor the activity was detected in the other two p160 family members, SRC1 and RAC3. The same GRIP1 corepression domain was required for GR-mediated repression at the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) tethering GRE of the human IL-8 gene. In contrast, at the osteocalcin gene GRE, where GR represses transcription by binding to a DNA site overlapping the TATA box, both GRIP1 and SRC1 corepressed, and the GRIP1-specific repression domain was dispensable. Thus, in a single cell type, GR and GRIP1 conferred one mode of activation and two modes of repression by selectively engaging distinct surfaces of GRIP1 in a response element-specific manner.", "meta": {"pmid": 12481024}}

A key enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway is nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT), and here, we describe GNE-618, an NAMPT inhibitor that depletes NAD and induces cell death in vitro and in vivo. While cells proficient for nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (NAPRT1) can be protected from NAMPT inhibition as they convert nicotinic acid (NA) to NAD independent of the salvage pathway, this protection only occurs if NA is added before NAD depletion. We also demonstrate that tumor cells are unable to generate NAD by de novo synthesis as they lack expression of key enzymes in this pathway, thus providing a mechanistic rationale for the reliance of tumor cells on the NAD salvage pathway. Identifying tumors that are sensitive to NAMPT inhibition is one potential way to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of an NAMPT inhibitor, and here, we show that NAMPT, but not NAPRT1, mRNA and protein levels inversely correlate with sensitivity to GNE-618 across a panel of 53 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines. Finally, we demonstrate that GNE-618 reduced tumor growth in a patient-derived model, which is thought to more closely represent heterogeneous primary patient tumors. Thus, we show that dependence of tumor cells on the NAD salvage pathway renders them sensitive to GNE-618 in vitro and in vivo, and our data support further evaluation of the use of NAMPT mRNA and protein levels as predictors of overall sensitivity.

Based on the distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of warfarin, the relationship between the maintenance dose and the steady-state anticoagulation effect was simplified and an approach for the maintenance dose adjustment was proposed. According to the steady-state anticoagulation effect before and after multiple doses (0.1 mg kg(-1)day(-1)), the optimal maintenance doses were predicted for the target anticoagulation effect (INR(target)=2.5), then the actual anticoagulation effect (prothrombin times, PT) on the 6th (8 pm)\\8th (8 am)\\10th (2 pm) day after dose adjustment according the present method was compared with the target effects with a view of determination the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach. The proposed method was also used to adjust warfarin maintenance doses in the presence of metabolism inhibitor metronidazole. The results suggested that the proposed approach could appropriately achieve the target international normalized ratio (INR(target)) when warfarin used alone or in combination with metronidazole, the actual INR values of three days were 2.69+/-0.18 and 2.52+/-0.22 (mean+/-S.D.), respectively.

HKG expression varies in response to hypoxia but the effect of manipulations of serum availability, a common experimental procedure, remains unknown. Also, no data on HKG expression stability across colon adenocarcinoma lines that would aid selection of normalizers suitable for studies involving several lines are available. Thus, we evaluated the effect of serum availability on the expression of commonly used HKG (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, IPO8, MRPL19, PGK1, PPIA, RPLP0, RPS23, SDHA, TBP, UBC, and YWHAZ) in seven colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (Caco-2, DLD-1, HCT116, HT29, Lovo, SW480, and SW620). Sets of stably expressed line-specific and pan-line HKG were validated against absolutely quantified CDKN1A, TP53, and MDK transcripts. Both serum availability and line type affected HKG expression. UBC was fourfold down-regulated and HPRT1 1.75-fold up-regulated in re-fed HT29 cultures. Line-to-line variability in HKG expression was more pronounced than that caused by altering serum availability and could be found even between isogenic cell lines. PPIA, RPLP0, YWHAZ, and IPO8 were repeatedly highly ranked while ACTB, B2M, UBC, and PGK1 were ranked poorly. Normalization against PPIA/RPLP0/SDHA was found optimal for studies involving various colon adenocarcinoma cell lines subjected to manipulations of serum availability.

Furthermore, patient compliance was evaluated. Enuresis episodes and nocturnal urine production was recorded every night during two base-line weeks without treatment and during 2 weeks with 20-40 micrograms desmopressin at bedtime. During both periods fluid intake and micturition volumes were recorded for 2 days. Desmopressin response was defined as > 50% reduction in wet nights during treatment. It was found that patient compliance was acceptable in most patients. Regarding urine output it was found that base-line nocturnal urine production was significantly higher during nights when enuresis occurred than during \"dry\" nights and significantly higher in desmopressin responders compared with desmopressin non-responders. During treatment with desmopressin, nocturnal urine production in desmopressin responders decreased to levels similar to those of non-responders. The results confirm inpatient circadian studies of urine output and emphasise the importance of nocturnal polyuria in patients with monosymptomatic enuresis.

{"text": "Global loss of DNA methylation is frequently observed in the genome of human tumors. Although this epigenetic alteration is clearly associated with cancer progression, the way it exerts its pro-tumoral effect remains incompletely understood. A remarkable consequence of DNA hypomethylation in tumors is the aberrant activation of \"cancer-germline\" genes (also known as \"cancer-testis\" genes), which comprise a diverse group of germline-specific genes that use DNA methylation as a primary mechanism for repression in normal somatic tissues. Here we review the evidence that such cancer-germline genes contribute to key processes of tumor development. Notably, several cancer-germline genes were found to stimulate oncogenic pathways involved in cell proliferation (SSX, DDX43, MAEL, PIWIL1), angiogenesis (DDX53), immortality (BORIS/CTCFL), and metastasis (CT-GABRA3). Others appear to inhibit tumor suppressor pathways, including those controlling growth inhibition signals (MAGEA11, MAGEB2), apoptosis (MAGEA2, MAGEC2), and genome integrity (HORMAD1, NXF2). Cancer-germline genes were also implicated in the regulation of tumor metabolism (MAGEA3/MAGEA6). Together, our survey substantiates the concept that DNA hypomethylation promotes tumorigenesis via transcriptional activation of oncogenes. Importantly, considering their highly restricted pattern of expression, cancer-germline genes may represent valuable targets for the development of anti-cancer therapies with limited side effects.", "meta": {"pmid": 28342986}}

NSAIDs and ASA-associated UGIB rates were similar between <65 years (345 patients) (group 1) and \u226565 years (179 patients) (group 2) (28.4% versus 23.5%, p = 0.225 and 13% versus 19%, p = 0.071, resp.).

Using NSAIDs without gastroprotective drugs or using ASA with gastroprotective drugs in elderly patients is as safe as in adult patients.

Blind sterile (bs) mice carry a Tbc1d20-null mutation and exhibit cataracts and testicular phenotypes similar to those observed in WARBM4 patients. In addition to TBC1D20, mutations in RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2 and RAB18 cause WARBM1-3 respectively. However, regardless of which gene harbors the causative mutation, all individuals affected with WARBM exhibit indistinguishable clinical presentations. In contrast, bs, Rab3gap1 (-/-) , and Rab18 (-/-) mice exhibit distinct phenotypes; this phenotypic variability of WARBM mice was previously attributed to potential compensatory mechanisms. Rab3gap1 (-/-) and Rab18 (-/-) mice were genetically engineered using standard approaches, whereas the Tbc1d20 mutation in the bs mice arose spontaneously. There is the possibility that another unidentified mutation within the bs linkage disequilibrium may be contributing to the bs phenotypes and thus contributing to the phenotypic variability in WARBM mice. The goal of this study was to establish the phenotypic consequences in mice caused by the disruption of the Tbc1d20 gene. The zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) mediated genomic editing generated a Tbc1d20 c.[418_426del] deletion encoding a putative TBC1D20-ZFN protein with an in-frame p.[H140_Y143del] deletion within the highly conserved TBC domain. The evaluation of Tbc1d20 (ZFN/ZFN) eyes identified severe cataracts and thickened pupillary sphincter muscle. Tbc1d20 (ZFN/ZFN) males are infertile and the analysis of the seminiferous tubules identified disrupted acrosomal development. The compound heterozygote Tbc1d20 (ZFN/bs) mice, generated from an allelic bs/+ X Tbc1d20 (ZFN/+) cross, exhibited cataracts and aberrant acrosomal development indicating a failure to complement. Our findings show that the disruption of Tbc1d20 in mice results in cataracts and aberrant acrosomal formation, thus establishing bs and Tbc1d20 (ZFN/ZFN) as allelic variants.

Stac2, Stac1, and Stac3 transcripts are found at high, modest, and very low levels, respectively, in the cerebellum and forebrain, but their neuronal functions have been little investigated. Here, we tested the effects of Stac proteins on neuronal, high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. Overexpression of the three Stac isoforms eliminated Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of l-type current in rat neonatal hippocampal neurons (sex unknown), but not CDI of non-l-type current. Using heterologous expression in tsA201 cells (together with \u03b2 and \u03b12-\u03b41 auxiliary subunits), we found that CDI for CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 (the predominant, neuronal l-type Ca2+ channels) was suppressed by all three Stac isoforms, whereas CDI for the P/Q channel, CaV2.1, was not. For CaV1.2, the inhibition of CDI by the Stac proteins appeared to involve their direct interaction with the channel's C terminus. Within the Stac proteins, a weakly conserved segment containing \u223c100 residues and linking the structurally conserved PKC C1 and SH3_1 domains was sufficient to fully suppress CDI. The presence of CDI for l-type current in control neonatal neurons raised the possibility that endogenous Stac levels are low in these neurons and Western blotting indicated that the expression of Stac2 was substantially increased in adult forebrain and cerebellum compared with neonate. Together, our results indicate that one likely function of neuronal Stac proteins is to tune Ca2+ entry via neuronal l-type channels.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Stac protein, first identified 20 years ago in brain, has recently been found to be essential for proper trafficking and function of the skeletal muscle l-type Ca2+ channel and is the site of mutations causing a severe, inherited human myopathy. In neurons, however, functions for Stac protein have remained unexplored. Here, we report that one likely function of neuronal Stac proteins is tuning Ca2+ entry via l-type, but not that via non-l-type, Ca2+ channels.

To predict the potential targets and mechanism of polyphyllin II against NPC and explore its possibility for the future nano-pharmaceutics of Chinese medicine monomers, network pharmacology was included in the present study. Totally, ninety-four common potential targets for NPC and polyphyllin II were discovered. Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis showed that biological processes and functions mainly concentrated on apoptotic process, protein phosphorylation, cytosol, protein binding, and ATP binding. In addition, the anti-NPC effects of polyphyllin II mainly involved in the pathways related to cancer, especially in the PI3K-Akt signaling indicated by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The \"drug-target-disease\" network diagram indicated that the key genes were SRC, MAPK1, MAPK14, and AKT1. Taken together, this study revealed the potential drug targets and underlying mechanisms of polyphyllin II against NPC through modern network pharmacology, which provided a certain theoretical basis for the future nano TCM research.", "meta": {"pmid": 34007265}}
{"text": "Regulative circuits controlling expression of genes involved in the same biological processes are frequently interconnected. These circuits operate to coordinate the expression of multiple genes and also to compensate dysfunctions in specific elements of the network. Caspases are cysteine-proteases with key roles in the execution phase of apoptosis. Silencing of caspase-2 expression in cultured glioblastoma cells allows the up-regulation of a limited number of genes, among which some are related to cholesterol homeostasis. Lysosomal Acid Lipase A (LIPA) was up-regulated in two different cell lines in response to caspase-2 down-regulation and cells silenced for caspase-2 exhibit reduced cholesterol staining in the lipid droplets. We expanded this observation by large-scale analysis of mRNA expression. All caspases were analyzed in terms of co-expression in comparison with 166 genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. In the brain, hierarchical clustering has revealed that the expression of regulative apoptotic caspases (CASP2, CASP8 CASP9, CASP10) and of the inflammatory CASP1 is linked to several genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. These correlations resulted in altered GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme), in particular for CASP1. We have also demonstrated that these correlations are tissue specific being reduced (CASP9 and CASP10) or different (CASP2) in the liver.

{"text": "Estrogen enhances antibody and autoantibody responses through yet to be defined mechanisms. It has been suggested that estrogen up-regulates the expression of activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID), which is critical for antibody class switch DNA recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), through direct activation of this gene. AID, as we have shown, is induced by the HoxC4 homeodomain transcription factor, which binds to a conserved HoxC4/Oct site in the AICDA/Aicda promoter. Here we show that estrogen-estrogen receptor (ER) complexes do not directly activate the AID gene promoter in B cells undergoing CSR. Rather, they bind to three evolutionarily conserved and cooperative estrogen response elements (EREs) we identified in the HOXC4/HoxC4 promoter. By binding to these EREs, ERs synergized with CD154 or LPS and IL-4 signaling to up-regulate HoxC4 expression, thereby inducing AID and CSR without affecting B cell proliferation or plasmacytoid differentiation. Estrogen administration in vivo significantly potentiated CSR and SHM in the specific antibody response to the 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten conjugated with chicken \u03b3-globulin. Ablation of HoxC4 (HoxC4(-/-)) abrogated the estrogen-mediated enhancement of AID gene expression and decreased CSR and SHM. Thus, estrogen enhances AID expression by activating the HOXC4/HoxC4 promoter and inducing the critical AID gene activator, HoxC4.", "meta": {"pmid": 20855884}}
{"text": "The hypercoagulable state associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) results in increased risk of venous thromboembolism, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), whereby activated neutrophils release their intracellular contents containing DNA, histones, tissue factor, high mobility group box\u00a01 (HMGB1) and other components have been implicated in PDA and in cancer-associated thrombosis. Utilizing an orthotopic murine PDA model in C57/Bl6 mice and patient correlative samples, we studied the role of NETs in PDA hypercoagulability and targeted this pathway through treatment with the NET inhibitor chloroquine. PAD4 and RAGE knockout mice, deficient in NET formation, were used to study the role of NETs in platelet aggregation, release of tissue factor and hypercoagulability. Platelet aggregation was assessed using collagen-activated impedance aggregometry. Levels of circulating tissue factor, the initiator of extrinsic coagulation, were measured using ELISA. Thromboelastograms (TEGs) were performed to assess hypercoagulability and changes associated with treatment. Correlative data and samples from a randomized clinical trial of preoperative gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with and without hydroxychloroquine were studied and the impact of treatment on venous thromboembolism (VTE) rate was evaluated. The addition of NETs to whole blood stimulated platelet activation and aggregation. DNA and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were necessary for induction of NET associated platelet aggregation. PAD4 knockout tumor-burdened mice, unable to form NETs, had decreased aggregation and decreased circulating tissue factor. The NET inhibitor chloroquine reduces platelet aggregation, reduces circulating tissue factor and decreases hypercoagulability on TEG. Review of correlative data from patients treated on a randomized protocol of preoperative chemotherapy with and without hydroxychloroquine demonstrated a reduction in peri-operative VTE rate from 30 to 9.1% with hydroxychloroquine that neared statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.053) despite the trial not being designed to study VTE. NETs promote hypercoagulability in murine PDA through stimulation of platelets and release of tissue factor. Chloroquine inhibits NETs and diminishes hypercoagulability. These findings support clinical study of chloroquine to lower rates of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.

This study investigated how elevated CO(2) enhanced the development of root hairs in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The plants under elevated CO(2) (800 \u00b5L L(-1)) had denser and longer root hairs, and more H-positioned cells in root epidermis than those under ambient CO(2) (350 \u00b5L L(-1)). The elevated CO(2) increased auxin production in roots. Under elevated CO(2) , application of either 1-naphthoxyacetic acid (1-NOA) or N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) blocked the enhanced development of root hairs. The opposite was true when the plants under ambient CO(2) were treated with 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA), an auxin analogue. Furthermore, the elevated CO(2) did not enhance the development of root hairs in auxin-response mutants, axr1-3, and auxin-transporter mutants, axr4-1, aux1-7 and pin1-1. Both elevated CO(2) and NAA application increased expressions of caprice, triptychon and rho-related protein from plants 2, and decreased expressions of werewolf, GLABRA2, GLABRA3 and the transparent testa glabra 1, genes related to root-hair development, while 1-NOA and NPA application had an opposite effect.

{"text": "KRASG12C is among the most common oncogenic mutations in lung adenocarcinoma and a promising target for treatment by small-molecule inhibitors. KRAS oncogenic signaling is responsible for modulation of tumor microenvironment, with translation factors being among the most prominent deregulated targets. In the present study, we used TALENs to edit EGFRWT CL1-5 and A549 cells for integration of a Tet-inducible KRASG12C expression system. Subsequent analysis of both cell lines showed that cap-dependent translation was impaired in CL1-5 cells via involvement of mTORC2 and NF-\u03baB. In contrast, in A549 cells, which additionally harbor the KRASG12S mutation, cap-dependent translation was favored via recruitment of mTORC1, c-MYC and the positive regulation of eIF4F complex. Downregulation of eIF1, eIF5 and eIF5B in the same cell line suggested a stringency loss of start codon selection during scanning of mRNAs. Puromycin staining and polysome profile analysis validated the enhanced translation rates in A549 cells and the impaired cap-dependent translation in CL1-5 cells. Interestingly, elevated translation rates were restored in CL1-5 cells after prolonged induction of KRASG12C through an mTORC1/p70S6K-independent way.

{"text": "Our recent studies on human airway serous-like Calu-3 cells showed that cAMP agonists stimulated a HCO3(-) rich secretion containing up to 80 mM HCO3(-). This alkaline secretion relied on a coordinated switch in the activity of distinct Cl(-)-HCO3(-) anion exchangers (AE) located at different regions of the cell. At the apical membrane, cAMP agonists activated the electroneutral AE pendrin (SLC26A4), together with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), while at the basolateral membrane the agonists inhibited AE2 (SLC4A2). However, the underlying mechanism(s) that orchestrates this cAMP-dependent switch in AE activity has not been elucidated. Apical and basolateral Cl(-)-HCO3(-) exchange was assessed by measuring Cl(-)-dependent changes in intracellular pH (pH(i)). We show that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), together with CFTR, play central roles in this reciprocal regulation of AE activity. Activation of pendrin by cAMP agonists, but not inhibition of the basolateral exchanger, was protein kinase A-dependent. Knocking down CFTR expression, or blocking its activity with GlyH-101, led to incomplete inhibition of the basolateral AE by cAMP, supporting a role for CFTR in this process. Addition of the PP1/2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, but not the PP2A specific inhibitor fostreicin, mimicked the effect of cAMP stimulation. Furthermore, okadaic acid-treated Calu-3 monolayers produced a more alkaline fluid than untreated cells, which was comparable with that produced by cAMP stimulation. These results identify PP1 as a novel regulator of AE activity which, in concert with CFTR, coordinates events at both apical and basolateral membranes, crucial for efficient HCO3(-) secretion from Calu-3 cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 23215877}}

{"text": "The Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, is among the most promising species to unravel the suites of genes underling the density-dependent shift from shy and cryptic solitarious behaviour to the highly active and aggregating gregarious behaviour that is characteristic of locusts. This is because it lacks many of the major phenotypic changes in colour and morphology that accompany phase change in other locust species. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most sensitive method available for determining changes in gene expression. However, to accurately monitor the expression of target genes, it is essential to select an appropriate normalization strategy to control for non-specific variation between samples. Here we identify eight potential reference genes and examine their expression stability at different rearing density treatments in neural tissue of the Australian plague locust. Taking advantage of the new orthologous DNA sequences available in locusts, we developed primers for genes encoding 18SrRNA, ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32), armadillo (Arm), actin 5C (Actin), succinate dehydrogenase (SDHa), glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a) and annexin IX (AnnIX). The relative transcription levels of these eight genes were then analyzed in three treatment groups differing in rearing density (isolated, short- and long-term crowded), each made up of five pools of four neural tissue samples from 5th instar nymphs. SDHa and GAPDH, which are both involved in metabolic pathways, were identified as the least stable in expression levels, challenging their usefulness in normalization. Based on calculations performed with the geNorm and NormFinder programs, the best combination of two genes for normalization of gene expression data following crowding in the Australian plague locust was EF1a and Arm. We applied their use to studying a target gene that encodes a Ca2+ binding glycoprotein, SPARC, which was previously found to be up-regulated in brains of gregarious desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria. Interestingly, expression of this gene did not vary with rearing density in the same way in brains of the two locust species. Unlike S. gregaria, there was no effect of any crowding treatment in the Australian plague locust. Arm and EF1a is the most stably expressed combination of two reference genes of the eight examined for reliable normalization of RT-qPCR assays studying density-dependent behavioural change in the Australian plague locust. Such normalization allowed us to show that C. terminifera crowding did not change the neuronal expression of the SPARC gene, a gregarious phase-specific gene identified in brains of the desert locust, S. gregaria. Such comparative results on density-dependent gene regulation provide insights into the evolution of gregarious behaviour and mass migration of locusts.

{"text": "Gonad morphogenesis relies on the correct spatiotemporal expression of a number of genes that together fulfill the differentiation of the bipotential gonad into testes or ovaries. As such, the transcription factors WT1 and GATA4 are pivotal for proper gonadal development. Here we address the contributions of GATA4 and WT1 to the sex differentiation phase in testes and ovaries. We applied an ex vivo technique for cultivating gonads in hanging droplets of media that were supplemented with vivo-morpholinos to knockdown WT1 and GATA4 either alone or in combination at the same developmental stage. We show that WT1 is equally important for both, the initial establishment and the maintenance of the sex-specific gene expression signature in testes and ovaries. We further identified Foxl2 as a novel putative downstream target gene of WT1. Moreover, knockdown of WT1 reduced mRNA levels of several molecular components of the hedgehog signaling pathway in XY gonads, whereas Gata4 vivo-morpholino treatment increased transcripts of Dhh and Ptch1 in embryonic testes. The data suggest that for its proper function, WT1 relies on the correct expression of the GATA4 protein. Furthermore, GATA4 down-regulates several ovarian promoting genes in testes, such as Ctnnb1, Fst, and Bmp2, suggesting that this repression is required for maintaining the male phenotype.

{"text": "Sphingolipids exhibit extreme functional and chemical diversity that is in part determined by their hydrophobic moiety, ceramide. In mammals, the fatty acyl chain length variation of ceramides is determined by six (dihydro)ceramide synthase (CerS) isoforms. Previously, we and others showed that mutations in the major neuron-specific CerS1, which synthesizes 18-carbon fatty acyl (C18) ceramide, cause elevation of long-chain base (LCB) substrates and decrease in C18 ceramide and derivatives in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration in mice and myoclonus epilepsy with dementia in humans. Whether LCB elevation or C18 ceramide reduction leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Here, we ectopically expressed CerS2, a nonneuronal CerS producing C22-C24 ceramides, in neurons of Cers1-deficient mice. Surprisingly, the Cers1 mutant pathology was almost completely suppressed. Because CerS2 cannot replenish C18 ceramide, the rescue is likely a result of LCB reduction. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that only LCBs, the substrates common for all of the CerS isoforms, but not ceramides and complex sphingolipids, were restored to the wild-type levels in the Cers2-rescued Cers1 mutant mouse brains. Furthermore, LCBs induced neurite fragmentation in cultured neurons at concentrations corresponding to the elevated levels in the CerS1-deficient brain.

{"text": "During prion infections of the central nervous system (CNS) the cellular prion protein, PrP(C), is templated to a conformationally distinct form, PrP(Sc). Recent studies have demonstrated that the Sprn gene encodes a GPI-linked glycoprotein Shadoo (Sho), which localizes to a similar membrane environment as PrP(C) and is reduced in the brains of rodents with terminal prion disease. Here, analyses of prion-infected mice revealed that down-regulation of Sho protein was not related to Sprn mRNA abundance at any stage in prion infection. Down-regulation was robust upon propagation of a variety of prion strains in Prnp(a) and Prnp(b) mice, with the exception of the mouse-adapted BSE strain 301 V. In addition, Sho encoded by a TgSprn transgene was down-regulated to the same extent as endogenous Sho. Reduced Sho levels were not seen in a tauopathy, in chemically induced spongiform degeneration or in transgenic mice expressing the extracellular ADan amyloid peptide of familial Danish dementia. Insofar as prion-infected Prnp hemizygous mice exhibited accumulation of PrP(Sc) and down-regulation of Sho hundreds of days prior to onset of neurologic symptoms, Sho depletion can be excluded as an important trigger for clinical disease or as a simple consequence of neuronal damage. These studies instead define a disease-specific effect, and we hypothesize that membrane-associated Sho comprises a bystander substrate for processes degrading PrP(Sc). Thus, while protease-resistant PrP detected by in vitro digestion allows post mortem diagnosis, decreased levels of endogenous Sho may trace an early response to PrP(Sc) accumulation that operates in the CNS in vivo.

Pramlintide complements the effects of insulin in postprandial glucose regulation by decreasing glucagon secretion. Pramlintide exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, and peak serum levels are reached within 30 minutes of administration. The drug is predominantly renally eliminated, with a mean elimination half-life of 30-50 minutes. Clinical trials have shown that pramlintide suppresses postmeal glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, reduces postprandial glucose levels, and improves glycemic control while managing weight loss. Pramlintide has also been shown to decrease hemoglobin A(1c), serum fructosamine, and total cholesterol levels. Pramlintide has been associated with an increased risk of insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia; other adverse events include nausea, anorexia, fatigue, and vomiting.

Effects on spermatogenesis in the cultured testes were investigated as functions of both time and dose. Resmethrin significantly downregulated the transcription levels of marker genes for spermatogonia and the number of spermatogenic germ cells relative to those of the controls, according to quantitative PCR and immunostaining. In addition, spermatocyte was observed in the control, but not in 50\u2009\u03bcM resmethrin-exposed cultures.

The specific biological role of the SPOC domain (Spen paralog and ortholog C-terminal domain), and hence, the common function of Spen proteins, has been unclear to date. The Spen protein, SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein), was identified as a component of transcriptional repression complexes in both nuclear receptor and Notch/RBP-Jkappa signaling pathways. We have determined the 1.8 A crystal structure of the SPOC domain from SHARP. This structure shows that essentially all of the conserved surface residues map to a positively charged patch. Structure-based mutational analysis indicates that this conserved region is responsible for the interaction between SHARP and the universal transcriptional corepressor SMRT/NCoR (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors/nuclear receptor corepressor. We demonstrate that this interaction involves a highly conserved acidic motif at the C terminus of SMRT/NCoR. These findings suggest that the conserved function of the SPOC domain is to mediate interaction with SMRT/NCoR corepressors, and that Spen proteins play an essential role in the repression complex.", "meta": {"pmid": 12897056}}

Mice were immunized with ovalbumin in the presence of aluminium hydroxide gel or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Two weeks after the immunization, ACA was elicited in the mouse ear by injecting 10 microliters of antigen solution intradermally into the ear lobe. ACA was assessed by the amount of extravasated dye, which was given intravenously just after the antigen injection. Antiallergic drugs (tranilast, ketotifen and azelastine), antihistamines (chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine and mequitazine), beta-stimulants (isoproterenol and salbutamol), theophylline and glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone, prednisolone and dexamethasone) inhibited the reaction significantly. These drugs inhibited both ACA in mice immunized with alum-precipitated antigen and ACA in mice injected with CFA-emulsified antigen similarly.

{"text": "Among prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have an exclusive position as they perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria substantially differ from other bacteria in further aspects, e.g., they evolved a plethora of unique regulatory mechanisms to control primary metabolism. This is exemplified by the regulation of glutamine synthetase (GS) via small proteins termed inactivating factors (IFs). Here, we reveal another small protein, encoded by the ssr0692 gene in the model strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, that regulates flux into the ornithine-ammonia cycle (OAC), the key hub of cyanobacterial nitrogen stockpiling and remobilization. This regulation is achieved by the interaction with the central carbon/nitrogen control protein PII, which commonly controls entry into the OAC by activating the key enzyme of arginine synthesis, N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK). In particular, the Ssr0692 protein competes with NAGK for PII binding and thereby prevents NAGK activation, which in turn lowers arginine synthesis. Accordingly, we termed it P II-interacting regulator of arginine synthesis (PirA). Similar to the GS IFs, PirA accumulates in response to ammonium upshift due to relief from repression by the global nitrogen control transcription factor NtcA. Consistent with this, the deletion of pirA affects the balance of metabolite pools of the OAC in response to ammonium shocks. Moreover, the PirA-PII interaction requires ADP and is prevented by PII mutations affecting the T-loop conformation, the major protein interaction surface of this signal processing protein. Thus, we propose that PirA is an integrator determining flux into N storage compounds not only depending on the N availability but also the energy state of the cell.IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria contribute a significant portion to the annual oxygen yield and play important roles in biogeochemical cycles, e.g., as major primary producers. Due to their photosynthetic lifestyle, cyanobacteria also arouse interest as hosts for the sustainable production of fuel components and high-value chemicals. However, their broad application as microbial cell factories is hampered by limited knowledge about the regulation of metabolic fluxes in these organisms. Our research identified a novel regulatory protein that controls nitrogen flux, in particular arginine synthesis. Besides its role as a proteinogenic amino acid, arginine is a precursor for the cyanobacterial storage compound cyanophycin, which is of potential interest to biotechnology. Therefore, the obtained results will not only enhance our understanding of flux control in these organisms but also help to provide a scientific basis for targeted metabolic engineering and, hence, the design of photosynthesis-driven biotechnological applications.", "meta": {"pmid": 33758091}}
{"text": "Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) is a human disease that results from failure of the fetal vasculature to regress normally. The regulatory mechanisms responsible for fetal vascular regression remain obscure, as does the underlying cause of regression failure. However, there are a few animal models that mimic the clinical manifestations of human PFV, which can be used to study different aspects of the disease. One such model is the Nuc1 rat model that arose from a spontaneous mutation in the Cryba1 (crystallin, beta 1) gene and exhibits complete failure of the hyaloid vasculature to regress. Our studies with the Nuc1 rat indicate that macroautophagy/autophagy, a process in eukaryotic cells for degrading dysfunctional components to ensure cellular homeostasis, is severely impaired in Nuc1 ocular astrocytes. Further, we show that CRYBA1 interacts with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and that loss of this interaction in Nuc1 astrocytes increases EGFR levels. Moreover, our data also show a reduction in EGFR degradation in Nuc1 astrocytes compared to control cells that leads to over-activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (MTORC1) pathway. The impaired EGFR-MTORC1-autophagy signaling in Nuc1 astrocytes triggers abnormal proliferation and migration. The abnormally migrating astrocytes ensheath the hyaloid artery, contributing to the pathogenesis of PFV in Nuc1, by adversely affecting the vascular remodeling processes essential to regression of the fetal vasculature. Herein, we demonstrate in vivo that gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) can rescue the PFV phenotype in Nuc1 and may serve as a novel therapy for PFV disease by modulating the EGFR-MTORC1-autophagy pathway.

Due to the progressive nature of the disease, a combination(s) of two or more drugs acting on different pathophysiological process is often necessary to achieve early and sustained achievement of individualized glycemic targets. At the same time, choosing the safest option to avoid hypoglycemia is of paramount importance. GLP-1 analogues are a relatively recent class of anti-diabetic drugs, and are highly effective with an acceptable safety profile. Attempts have been made to combine GLP-1 analogues with basal insulin for management of T2DM. Presently GLP-1 analogues like exenatide/long acting exenatide and liraglutide have been co-administered with basal insulin like glargine and detemir respectively, and are approved by regulatory agencies. Currently a fixed dose combination (FDC) of insulin degludec and liraglutide is under development. GLP-1 analogue and insulin as FDC or by co-administration, is a rational method of controlling fasting and postprandial glucose effectively. The efficacy and safety of this combination has been studied in a wide population with promising outcomes. Innovative use of GLP-1 analogues beyond diabetes is also being attempted, and a variety of patents are filed or granted for the same.

{"text": "While cancer has been long recognized as a disease of the genome, the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in neoplasia was acknowledged more recently. The most active epigenetic marks are DNA methylation and histone protein modifications and they are involved in basic biological phenomena in every cell. Their role in tumorigenesis is stressed by recent unbiased large-scale studies providing evidence that several epigenetic modifiers are recurrently mutated or frequently dysregulated in multiple cancers. The interest in epigenetic marks is especially due to the fact that they are potentially reversible and thus druggable. In B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) there is a relative paucity of reports on the role of histone protein modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) as compared to acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell ALL, or other hematologic cancers, and in this setting chromatin modifications are relatively less well studied and reviewed than DNA methylation. In this paper, we discuss the biomarker associations and evidence for a driver role of dysregulated global and loci-specific histone marks, as well as mutations in epigenetic modifiers in BCP-ALL. Examples of chromatin modifiers recurrently mutated/disrupted in BCP-ALL and associated with disease outcomes include MLL1, CREBBP, NSD2, and SETD2. Altered histone marks and histone modifiers and readers may play a particular role in disease chemoresistance and relapse. We also suggest that epigenetic regulation of B-cell differentiation may have parallel roles in leukemogenesis.", "meta": {"pmid": 28054944}}
{"text": "Neuroanatomical studies have shown relaxin-3 neurons, primarily found in the rodent nucleus incertus (NI), project widely into a large number of areas expressing the relaxin-3 receptor (RXFP3), and these data suggest relaxin-3/RXFP3 signaling modulates sensory, emotional, and neuroendocrine processing. The similar distribution of this receptor-ligand pair in the rat, mouse, and monkey brain suggests that experimental findings obtained in lower species will translate to higher species. A role for relaxin-3 and RXFP3 in modulating stress responses is strongly suggested by the expression of corticotropin-releasing factor R1 (CRF-R1) by NI cells, increased relaxin-3 expression in the NI after stress or CRF injection, and hormonal responses to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) relaxin-3 injection. Recent data are consistent with a further role for this ligand-receptor pair in modulating memory. In addition, relaxin-3 has been reported to modulate feeding and body weight control. Acute or chronic central (i.c.v. or intraparaventricular) injections of relaxin-3 have shown a consistent stimulatory effect on food consumption while relaxin was inactive, suggesting the phagic effect of relaxin-3 is mediated by RXFP3. We have confirmed the role of RXFP3 in modulating feeding and body weight by using a selective RXFP3 agonist (R3/I5) and antagonist [R3(Delta23-27)R/I5], collecting feeding, body weight, hormone, and body composition data. In addition, we have preliminary body weight and magnetic resonance imaging data from relaxin-3 knockout mice, which on a 129S5:B6 background are smaller and leaner than congenic controls.

BSCR is also associated with endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), an enzyme involved in processing HLA class I ligands, thus implicating the A*29:02 peptidome in this disease. To investigate the relationship between both risk factors we employed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize the effects of ERAP2 on the A*29:02-bound peptidome. An ERAP2-negative cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing GFP-ERAP2 or GFP alone, and the A*29:02 peptidomes from both transduced cells were compared. A similar analysis was performed with two additional A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines expressing or not ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides >9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from ERAP1 over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues can be explained by a direct effect of ERAP2 on trimming, without ruling out and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing. These differ from those on the ankylosing spondylitis-associated HLA-B*27. Thus, ERAP2 alters the peptidome of distinct HLA molecules as a function of their specific binding preferences, influencing different pathological outcomes in an allele-dependent way.", "meta": {"pmid": 29769354}}

{"text": "Cholesterol ester-laden macrophage foam cells are a hallmark of atherosclerosis. The cycle of esterification and hydrolysis of cholesterol esters is one of the key steps in macrophage cholesterol trafficking. In the process of foam cell formation, excess free cholesterol undergoes esterification by acyl coenzyme A: acylcholesterol transferase 1 (ACAT-1), and fatty acid sterol esters are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The actions of ACAT-1 are opposed by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH), which generates free cholesterol and fatty acids. The resulting free cholesterol is a preferential source for cholesterol efflux into the extracellular space. Despite the important role of nCEH in protection against foam cell formation and atherosclerosis, the molecular identity of nCEH has long been debated. Although hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) has been proposed to be the nCEH in macrophages, recent evidence suggested the existence of other nCEH(s). We have recently identified a novel nCEH, neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1), and demonstrated that NCEH1, in addition to LIPE, primarily mediates the hydrolysis of CE in macrophages. This review focuses on the protective roles of nCEHs in atherosclerosis, with special emphasis on the role of NCEH1.", "meta": {"pmid": 21467808}}

Although AID specifically targets the Ig gene loci (IgH, Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bb), it can also home into a wide array of non-Ig genes in B-and non-B-cell backgrounds. Aberrant expression of AID is associated with multiple diseases such as allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer. In autoimmune systemic lupus erythematosus, dysregulated AID expression underpins increased CSR, SHM and autoantibody production. As a potent mutator, AID is under stringent transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. AID is also regulated in its targeting and enzymatic function. In resting na\u00efve or memory B cells, AID transcripts and protein are undetectable. These, however, are readily and significantly up-regulated in B cells induced to undergo CSR and/or SHM. Transcription factors, such as HoxC4 and NF-\u03baB, which are up-regulated in a B cell lineage-and/or differentiation stage-specific manner, regulate the induction of AID. HoxC4 induces AID expression by directly binding to the AID gene promoter through an evolutionarily conserved 5'-ATTT-3' motif. HoxC4 is induced by the same stimuli that induce AID and CSR. It is further up-regulated by estrogen through three estrogen responsive elements in its promoter region. The targeting of AID to switch (S) regions is mediated by 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, which specifically bind to 5'-AGCT-3' repeats that are exist at high frequency in S region cores. Like HoxC4, 14-3-3 adaptors are induced by the same stimuli that induce AID. These include \"primary\" inducing stimuli, that is, those that play a major role in inducing AID, i.e., engagement of CD40 by CD154, engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and cross-linking of the BCR, as synergized by \"secondary\" inducing stimuli, that is, those that synergize for AID induction and specify CSR to different isotypes, i.e., switch-directing cytokines IL-4, TGF-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3. In this review, we focus on the multi-levels regulation of AID expression and activity. We also discuss the dysregulation or misexpression of AID in autoimmunity and tumorigenesis.", "meta": {"pmid": 23181381}}

A phase IV multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with PD who began receiving R+ATD, R, or ATD between September 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, treatment details, and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits. An adjudication committee independently reviewed records to verify case ascertainment and used the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria for case definition. Outcome variables were analyzed by descriptive statistics. A total of 1504 patients with PD (471 with R+ATD; 511 with R; and 525 with ATD) were enrolled from 37 sites. In the R+ATD and ATD groups, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were most frequently used (74.5% and 77%, respectively). In the R+ATD and ATD groups, mean duration of antidepressant use (tricyclic, SSRI, and other) were 50.5-53.5 weeks and 51.7-80.9 weeks, respectively. Overall, 195 patients (13%) from all three groups had one or more hospitalization/ED visits. No cases of STS were identified in any group.

(2004) and seek to link such vulnerability to changes in expression of various mu opioid receptor and D2 receptor-interacting proteins in brain. The results show that the greatest heroin-induced suppression of intake of a saccharin cue is associated with the greatest vulnerability to later addiction-like behavior and to differences in the expression of WLS, \u03b2-catenin, and NCS-1 in brain compared to rats that exhibited the least suppression of intake of the heroin-paired cue and/or saline controls.

{"text": "The contribution ratios (CR) of metabolic enzymes to the systemic clearance of a drug can be estimated from in vitro studies. Another feasible approach is to calculate them based on the increase in the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) caused by the co-administration of a potent and selective inhibitor in a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study. However, some factors, such as the inhibitory potency of the inhibitor and the inhibition of first-pass metabolism, might affect the estimation of CR based on clinical DDI studies. We aimed to validate the accuracy of the DDI-based estimation of CR using an in silico approach. An in silico DDI study was conducted using a population-based physiological pharmacokinetic simulator to estimate the CR of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 for zolpidem, sildenafil, omeprazole, triazolam, and repaglinide. The ratio of the AUC value seen in the presence of an inhibitor (ketoconazole or itraconazole) to that observed in the absence of the inhibitor (AUC ratio) was also calculated. The CR for CYP3A4 obtained using the simulator (CRdef) were compared with those calculated from the AUC ratio (CRest). When ketoconazole was used, good correlations between the CRest and CRdef were obtained for all examined substrates (inconsistencies were seen in < 10% of subjects). CR estimates derived from the AUC ratio were found to be accurate. Some underestimation was observed, possibly due to incomplete inhibition, and some overestimation caused by extensive first-pass metabolism was noted.

{"text": "Longitudinal bone growth occurs within the epiphyseal growth plate, a highly organized biological structure located at the distal ends of the long bones, via endochondral bone formation. This developmentally regulated process is finely tuned through the interaction of circulating systemic hormones and locally produced peptide growth factors, the net result of which is to trigger changes in gene expression by growth plate chondrocytes. These molecular events lead to carefully orchestrated alterations in chondrocyte size, extracellular matrix components, secreted enzymes, growth factors and receptor expression. These events finally result in calcification of the matrix, chondrocyte death, vascular invasion and the completion of endochondral bone formation. Although the past several years have seen important progress in the identification of numerous important factors, which, in a complex and integrated network, control longitudinal bone growth, many of the signaling pathways and their interactions in the growth plate remain poorly understood.

A tissue microarray containing 170 breast cancers of no special type was immunostained for a panel of 21 P450s. The highest percentage of strong immunopositivity in breast cancers was seen for CYP4X1 (50.8%), CYP2S1 (37.5%) and CYP2U1 (32.2%), while CYP2J (98.6%) and CYP3A43 (70.7%) were the P450s that most frequently displayed no immunoreactivity.

To date, most ctDNA tests have been performed on patients with widely metastatic disease. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (metastases) present unique prognostic and therapeutic challenges. We therefore explored preoperative ctDNA in patients with peritoneal metastases undergoing surgery. Patients referred for surgical resection of peritoneal metastases underwent preoperative blood-derived ctDNA analysis (clinical-grade NGS [68-73 genes]). ctDNA was quantified as the percentage of altered circulating cell-free DNA (% cfDNA). Eighty patients had ctDNA testing: 46 (57.5%) women; median age 55.5\u00a0years. The following diagnoses were included: 59 patients (73.8%), appendix cancer; 11 (13.8%), colorectal; five (6.3%), peritoneal mesothelioma; two (2.5%), small bowel; one (1.3%) each of cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian, and testicular cancer. Thirty-one patients (38.8%) had detectable preoperative ctDNA alterations, most frequently in the following genes: TP53 (25.8% of all alterations detected) and KRAS (11.3%). Among 15 patients with tissue DNA NGS, 33.3% also had ctDNA alterations (overall concordance\u2009=\u200996.7%).

{"text": "Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified SNPs in the 8q24 locus near TRIB1 that are significantly associated with plasma lipids and other markers of cardiometabolic health, and prior studies have revealed the roles of hepatic and myeloid Trib1 in plasma lipid regulation and atherosclerosis. The same 8q24 SNPs are additionally associated with plasma adiponectin levels in humans, implicating TRIB1 in adipocyte biology. Here, we hypothesize that TRIB1 in adipose tissue regulates plasma adiponectin, lipids, and metabolic health. We investigate the metabolic phenotype of adipocyte-specific Trib1 knockout mice (Trib1_ASKO) fed on chow and high-fat diet (HFD). Through secretomics of adipose tissue explants and RNA-seq of adipocytes and livers from these mice, we further investigate the mechanism of TRIB1 in adipose tissue. Trib1_ASKO mice have an improved metabolic phenotype with increased plasma adiponectin levels, improved glucose tolerance, and decreased plasma lipids. Trib1_ASKO adipocytes have increased adiponectin production and secretion independent of the known TRIB1 function of regulating proteasomal degradation. RNA-seq analysis of adipocytes and livers from Trib1_ASKO mice indicates that alterations in adipocyte function underlie the observed plasma lipid changes. Adipose tissue explant secretomics further reveals that Trib1_ASKO adipose tissue has decreased ANGPTL4 production, and we demonstrate an accompanying increase in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity that likely underlies the triglyceride phenotype. This study shows that adipocyte Trib1 regulates multiple aspects of metabolic health, confirming previously observed genetic associations in humans and shedding light on the further mechanisms by which TRIB1 regulates plasma lipids and metabolic health.", "meta": {"pmid": 34890852}}
{"text": "Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) and RalGDS like (RGL) are putative effector proteins of Ras and contain the Ras-interacting domain (RID) at their C-terminal regions. v-Ras is known to activate c-fos promoter/enhancer and Raf-1 and to transform NIH3T3 cells. It is also known that v-Raf activates c-fos promoter/enhancer and transforms NIH3T3 cells. In this study, we examined the effect of RID on the phenotype of the cells transformed by v-Ras and v-Raf. Overexpression of RID greatly reduced cell growth in low serum, colony-forming activity in soft agar, c-fos promoter/enhancer activity, and Raf-1 activity of v-Ras-transformed cells. However, overexpression of RID did not affect the phenotype of v-Raf-transformed cells. These results clearly indicate that RID of RGL specifically binds to Ras in mammalian cells, that it blocks the signal from Ras to Raf-1, and that it reverses v-Ras-induced malignant phenotype. It has been reported that Ras-binding domains of Raf-1 and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) reverse v-Ras-induced malignant phenotype. Since there is no homology in primary structures of RGL, Raf-1, and NF1, there may be a similarity of secondary or tertiary structure among RID of RGL and Ras-binding domains of Raf-1 and NF1, and the structure might be useful for developing a potential medicine for human cancers caused by Ras.", "meta": {"pmid": 8625316}}

The aim of this study was to clarify the nature of candidate BM-MSCs by profiling transcripts that reflect different aspects of their putative functions in vivo. Rare, sorted BM-derived CD45(-/low) CD271(bright) (CD271) cells were analyzed using 96-gene expression arrays focused on transcripts relevant to mesenchymal-lineage differentiation (toward bone, cartilage, fat, or muscle), hematopoietic and stromal support, and molecules critical to skeletal homeostasis. These cells were compared to matched CD45+ CD271- hematopoietic-lineage cells, culture-expanded MSCs, and skin fibroblasts. When feasible, transcription was validated using flow cytometry. CD271 cells had a transcriptional profile consistent with the multiple fates of in vivo MSCs, evident from the observed simultaneous expression of osteogenic, adipogenic, pericytic, and hematopoiesis-supporting genes (e.g., SP7 [osterix], FABP4 [fatty acid binding protein 4], ANGPT1 [angiopoietin 1], and CXCL12 [stromal cell-derived factor 1], respectively). Compared to culture-expanded MSCs and fibroblasts, CD271 cells exhibited greater transcriptional activity, particularly with respect to Wnt-related genes (>1,000-fold increased expression of FRZB [secreted frizzled-related protein 3] and WIF1 [Wnt inhibitory factor 1]). A number of transcripts were identified as novel markers of MSCs. The native, BM-derived in vivo MSC population is endowed with a gene signature that is compatible with multiple functions, reflecting the topographic bone niche of these cells, and their signature is significantly different from that of culture-expanded MSCs. This indicates that studies of the biologic functions of MSCs in musculoskeletal diseases, including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, should focus on in vivo MSCs, rather than their culture-adapted progeny.", "meta": {"pmid": 22378497}}

Here, we demonstrate that the distribution of syntaxin mRNA in cell bodies of sensory neurons (SNs) of Aplysia maintained in cell culture is affected by synapse formation, synapse stabilization, and long-term facilitation (LTF) produced by 5-HT. The distribution of the mRNA in turn regulates expression and axonal transport of the protein. Syntaxin mRNA and protein accumulated at the axon hillock of SNs during the initial phase of synapse formation. Significant numbers of granules containing syntaxin were detected in the SN axon. When synaptic strength was stable, both mRNA and protein were targeted away from the axon hillock, and the number of syntaxin granules in the SN axon was reduced. Dramatic increases in mRNA and protein accumulation at the axon hillock and number of syntaxin granules in the SN axon were produced when cultures with stable connections were treated with 5-HT that evoked LTF. Anisomycin (protein synthesis inhibitor) or KT5720 (protein kinase A inhibitor) blocked LTF, accumulation of syntaxin mRNA and protein at the axon hillock, and the increase in syntaxin granules in SN axons. The results indicate that without significant effects on overall mRNA expression, both target interaction and 5-HT via activation of protein kinase A pathway regulate expression of syntaxin and its packaging for transport into axons by influencing the distribution of its mRNA in the SN cell body.", "meta": {"pmid": 12629184}}

We collected 37 primary angiosarcomas of bone and used 20 angiosarcomas of soft tissue for comparison. Immunohistochemistry was performed on constructed tissue microarrays to evaluate expression of CDKN2A, TP53, PTEN, BCL2, CDK4, MDM2, cyclin D1, \u03b2-catenin, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), CD105, phospho-Smad1, phospho-Smad2, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), VEGF, CD117 and glucose transporter--1. PIK3CA was screened for hotspot mutations in 19 angiosarcomas. In nearly 55% of the angiosarcoma of bone, the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway was affected. Loss of CDKN2A expression was associated with a significantly worse prognosis. No overexpression of TP53 or MDM2 was found, suggesting that the TP53 pathway is not important in angiosarcoma of bone. Angiosarcoma of bone showed highly active TGF-\u03b2 signaling with immunoreactivity for phospho-Smad2 and PAI-1.

{"text": "Inflammation resolution counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of resolution contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. Resolution is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes resolution, inhibition of ERK activation delayed resolution, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX-derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation resolution in settings where defective resolution promotes disease progression.", "meta": {"pmid": 30254055}}
{"text": "An excess of cholesterol and/or oxysterols induces apoptosis in macrophages, contributing to the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In foam cells, these sterols are stored in esterified forms, which are hydrolyzed by two enzymes: neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (Nceh1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe). A deficiency in either enzyme leads to accelerated growth of atherosclerotic lesions in mice. However, it is poorly understood how the esterification and hydrolysis of sterols are linked to apoptosis. Remarkably, Nceh1-deficient thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TGEMs), but not Lipe-deficient TGEMs, were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by oxysterols, particularly 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), and incubation with 25-HC caused massive accumulation of 25-HC ester in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to its defective hydrolysis, thereby activating ER stress signaling such as induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). These changes were nearly reversed by inhibition of ACAT1. In conclusion, deficiency of Nceh1 augments 25-HC-induced ER stress and subsequent apoptosis in TGEMs. In addition to reducing the cholesteryl ester content of foam cells, Nceh1 may protect against the pro-apoptotic effect of oxysterols and modulate the development of atherosclerosis.

MDS are due to defects in mtDNA maintenance caused by mutations in nuclear genes that function in either mitochondrial nucleotide synthesis (TK2, SUCLA2, SUCLG1, RRM2B, DGUOK, and TYMP) or mtDNA replication (POLG and C10orf2). MDS are phenotypically heterogeneous and usually classified as myopathic, encephalomyopathic, hepatocerebral or neurogastrointestinal. Myopathic MDS, caused by mutations in TK2, usually present before the age of 2\u00a0years with hypotonia and muscle weakness. Encephalomyopathic MDS, caused by mutations in SUCLA2, SUCLG1, or RRM2B, typically present during infancy with hypotonia and pronounced neurological features. Hepatocerebral MDS, caused by mutations in DGUOK, MPV17, POLG, or C10orf2, commonly have an early-onset liver dysfunction and neurological involvement. Finally, TYMP mutations have been associated with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease that typically presents before the age of 20\u00a0years with progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility and peripheral neuropathy. Overall, MDS are severe disorders with poor prognosis in the majority of affected individuals. No efficacious therapy is available for any of these disorders. Affected individuals should have a comprehensive evaluation to assess the degree of involvement of different systems. Treatment is directed mainly toward providing symptomatic management. Nutritional modulation and cofactor supplementation may be beneficial. Liver transplantation remains controversial. Finally, stem cell transplantation in MNGIE disease shows promising results.", "meta": {"pmid": 23385875}}
{"text": "Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a clinical syndrome presenting with progressive asymmetric bradykinesia, rigidity, and dystonia accompanied by cortical signs, such as apraxia, alien limb phenomena, cortical sensory loss, myoclonus, and mirror movements. CBS is associated with different pathological conditions including FTLD-tau (corticobasal degeneration, CBD; progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP: and Pick disease), FTLD-TDP, Alzheimer disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Parkinson disease/dementia with Lewy bodies. Among these, the most common pathology is CBD. In patients with familial and sporadic FTLD, MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 mutations are the three main causes of the disease, even though the C9orf72 mutation is rare in Japan. Patients with MAPT mutations present with FTLD-tau, and patients with GRN and C9orf72 mutations exhibit FTLD-TDP. FTLD is also associated with VCP, CHMP2B, TARDBP and FUS mutations, but each of these account for <1% of familial FTLD cases. In sporadic cases, the H1c haplotype and the rare p.A152T variant of MAPT are known to be associated with FTLD-tau, and the common genetic variant (rs5848) in the 3'-UTR of GRN is associated with FTLD-TDP. A recent genome-wide association study identified TMEM106B as a potential risk-modifying factor for FTLD-TDP, and STX6, EIF2AK3 and MOBP, for PSP. Despite major advances in genetic studies in recent years, the majority of sporadic CBS cases are genetically unsolved. Further studies are needed to unveil the genetic background of CBS. In this review, we discuss the recent advances related to the genetics of CBS, particularly about the genetics of FTLD.", "meta": {"pmid": 23300100}}

Eight patients with non-infected ascites were each given a single intravenous bolus of 2 gr cefotiam. Samples of blood and ascitic fluid were collected 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the injection. Plasma and ascitic fluid concentrations of unchanged cefotiam were determined using HPLC. Peak concentration in ascitic fluid averaged 18 micrograms/ml and was reached at two hours. Concentrations were still high (approximately 13 micrograms/ml) at 8 hours, leading to further assays 12 and 24 hours after the injection in three subjects.

{"text": "Klotho deficiency was observed in virtually all kinds of kidney disease and is thought to play a critical role in podocyte injury. However, the underline mechanisms involved in podocyte injury remain unknown. miRNAs have diverse regulatory roles, and miR-30 family members were essential for podocyte homeostasis. Our study revealed that Klotho and miR-30s were downregulated in PAN-treated podocytes. The ectopic expression of Klotho ameliorates PAN induced podocyte apoptosis through upregulating miR-30a and downregulating Ppp3ca, Ppp3cb, Ppp3r1, and Nfact3 expression, which are the known targets of miR-30s. We also found that Klotho regulates TRPC6 via miR-30a to activate calcium/calcineurin signaling. Further, glucocorticoid (Dexamethasone, DEX) was found to sustain Klotho and miR-30a levels during PAN treatment in\u00a0vitro. Eventually, in rats, PAN treatment substantially downregulated Klotho and miR-30a levels, lead to podocyte injury and increased proteinuria. The transfer of exogenous Klotho to podocytes of PAN-treated rats could increase miR-30a expression, reduce TRPC6 expression, and also ameliorated podocyte injury and proteinuria. In conclusion, Klotho, acting on miR-30s, which directly regulates its target genes, contributes to podocyte apoptosis induced by PAN. It is a novel mechanism underlying PAN-induced podocyte injury.", "meta": {"pmid": 33862465}}
{"text": "Primary dystonia is usually of adult onset, can be familial, and frequently involves the cervical musculature. Our goal was to identify the causal mutation in a family with adult onset, primary cervical dystonia. Linkage and haplotype analyses were combined with solution-based whole-exome capture and massively parallel sequencing in a large Caucasian pedigree with adult onset, primary cervical dystonia to identify a cosegregating mutation. High-throughput screening and Sanger sequencing were completed in 308 Caucasians with familial or sporadic adult onset cervical dystonia and matching controls for sequence variants in this mutant gene. Exome sequencing led to the identification of an exonic splicing enhancer mutation in exon 7 of CIZ1 (c.790A>G, p.S264G), which encodes CIZ1, Cip1-interacting zinc finger protein 1. CIZ1 is a p21(Cip1/Waf1) -interacting zinc finger protein expressed in brain and involved in DNA synthesis and cell-cycle control. Using a minigene assay, we showed that c.790A>G altered CIZ1 splicing patterns. The p.S264G mutation also altered the nuclear localization of CIZ1. Screening in subjects with adult-onset cervical dystonia identified 2 additional CIZ1 missense mutations (p.P47S and p.R672M). Mutations in CIZ1 may cause adult onset, primary cervical dystonia, possibly by precipitating neurodevelopmental abnormalities that manifest in adults and/or G1/S cell-cycle dysregulation in the mature central nervous system.", "meta": {"pmid": 22447717}}

{"text": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 and 2B17 expression is up-regulated by 17beta-estradiol in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, as assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Using 5'-deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that 17beta-estradiol activation of UGT2B15 gene transcription is mediated by a 282-base pair fragment positioned -454 to -172 nucleotides from the translation start site. This region contains two putative activator protein-1 (AP-1) elements, one imperfect estrogen response element (ERE), and two consensus ERE half-sites. We propose that these five sites act as an estrogen response unit (ERU), because mutation in any site reduces activation of the UGT2B15 promoter by 17beta-estradiol. Despite the presence of two AP-1 elements, the UGT2B15 promoter is not responsive to the AP-1 activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Although electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicate that the AP-1 proteins c-Jun and Fos-related antigen 2 (Fra-2) bound to the distal AP-1 site, binding of Jun or Fos family members to the proximal AP-1 site was not detected by EMSA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a 17beta-estradiol-induced recruitment of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, c-Jun, and Fra-2 to the 282-bp ERU. The involvement of these three transcription factors in the stimulation of UGT2B15 gene expression by 17beta-estradiol was confirmed by siRNA silencing experiments. Mutagenesis and siRNA experiments indicate that UGT2B17 expression is also regulated by 17beta-estradiol via the ERU, which is fully conserved in both promoters. Because UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 inactivate steroid hormones by glucuronidation, the regulation of their genes by 17beta-estradiol may maintain steroid hormone homeostasis and prevent excessive estrogen signaling activity.", "meta": {"pmid": 19487245}}

These animals were given normal diet (ND), high cholesterol diet (HCD: 2% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid added to ND), HCD supplemented with 2g and 8g fenugreek per 100g ND (HCD+FG2 and HCD+FG8) respectively for four weeks. At the end of treatment, serum lipids, lipoproteins and liver enzymes were measured. Finally, LDL receptor (LDLR) gene expression was determined in the liver of the studied animals using Real Time-PCR method and liver histological changes were evaluated by H&E staining method. A significant reduction was observed in serum triglyceride (p<0.01), total cholesterol, low and very low density cholesterol, aspartate and alanine transaminases in HCD+FG8 group (p<0.05) compared with HCD group, while serum level of HDL-c (p<0.01) increased. In addition, LDLR gene expression in HCD+FG8 group increased 7.8 folds. The results confirm the protection effect of liver tissue in HCD+FG8 group against pathological changes. There was no significant change in LDLR gene expression in HCD+FG2 group.

Tumour-derived microvesicles (TMVs) containing proteins, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and non-coding RNAs could contribute to cancer-induced muscle wasting. Differential ultracentrifugation was used to isolate TMVs from the conditioned medium of Lewis lung carcinoma and C26 colon carcinoma cell cultures. TMVs were added to the culture medium of C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes for 24-48-72\u00a0h, and the effects on protein and energy metabolism were assessed. TMVs were also isolated from the blood of C26-bearing mice. MicroRNA (miR) profile of TMVs was obtained by RNA-seq and validated by digital drop PCR. Selected miRs were overexpressed in C2C12 myoblasts to assess the effects on myogenic differentiation. Differentiation was delayed in C2C12 myoblasts exposed to TMVs, according to reduced expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC; about 62% of controls at Day 4) and myogenin (about 68% of controls at Day 4).

No correlation could be observed among miRs in the MVs obtained from the blood of the C26 host and those released by C26 cells in the culture medium. Overexpression of miR-148a-3p and miR-181a-5p in C2C12 myoblasts revealed the ability to impinge on the mRNA levels of Myf5, Myog, and MyHC (Myh4 and Myh7).

Some studies comparing St. John's wort to standard antidepressants suggest that it may be as effective as imipramine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat mild to moderate depression. Results from another clinical trial indicate that the effectiveness of St. John's wort is comparable to paroxetine, an SSRI, in the treatment of moderate to severe depression and is well tolerated.

IA-2 antibodies were detected in 64.7% of sera taken within 1 year of onset. Prevalence of IA-2 antibodies was lower than that of GAD65 antibodies. The difference in positivity in Asian IDDM patients between present and previous reports arose from the sensitivity of our assay for GAD65 antibodies. Additionally, the patients we studied had classic IDDM with a well-defined onset. We conclude that prevalence of GAD65 antibodies in Japanese IDDM patients is comparable to that in Western studies.

Finally, we identified 2-ketobutyric acid, 3-hexenedioic acid, but-2-enoic acid, and so on; 22 endogenous metabolites associated with AGA. After successful molding, we found that 2-ketobutyric acid, 3-hexenedioic acid, but-2-enoic acid, argininic acid, galactonic acid, lactic acid, equol 4'-O-glucuronide, deoxycholic acid glycine conjugate, glycocholic acid, sphinganine 1-phosphate, LPE (0:0/20:3), LPE (0:0/16:0), LPC (15:0) decreased significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), alanine, erythrulose, 3-dehydrocarnitine, m-methylhippuric acid, 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid, p-cresol sulfate, estriol 3-sulfate 16-glucuronide, 10-hydroxy-9-(phosphonooxy)octadecenoate, docosahexaenoic acid increased significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). After Gout Party treatment, 14 biomarkers had a tendency to normal conditions. These above biomarkers were mainly involved in fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism pathways. These results suggested that Gout Party exerted therapeutic effects of treating AGA by improving energy metabolism disorder and amino acid metabolism dysfunction, and attenuating fatty acid metabolism abnormal and inflammation. The results of this experiment provided a reference for revealing the metabolic mechanism produced by Gout Party in the treatment of AGA, but the subsequent studies need to be further improved and supported by relevant cell experiments and clinical experiments.", "meta": {"pmid": 31731809}}

Objective: To describe AMBER outcomes across patient subgroups based on demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. Methods: AMBER patients had viral load (VL) \u22651000 copies/mL, CD4+ cell count >50 cells/\u00b5L, and genotypic susceptibility to darunavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with virologic response (VL <50 copies/mL; FDA snapshot). Safety was assessed by adverse events, estimated glomerular filtration rate (cystatin C; eGFRcystC), and bone mineral density. Outcomes were assessed by age (\u2264/>50 years), gender, race (black/non-black), baseline VL (\u2264/>100,000 copies/mL), baseline CD4+ cell count (</\u2265200 cells/\u00b5L), and baseline WHO clinical stage of HIV infection (1/2). Results: For the 725 AMBER patients (D/C/F/TAF: 362; control: 363), virologic response rates at week 48 were similar with D/C/F/TAF (91%) and control (88%), and this was consistent across all subgroups. Adverse event rates were similar in both arms, although numerically higher among patients >50 years and women, relative to their comparator groups, regardless of treatment arm (notably, sample sizes were small for patients >50 years and women). Improvements in eGFRcystC and stable bone mineral density were observed with D/C/F/TAF overall, and results were generally consistent across subgroups. Conclusions: For treatment-na\u00efve patients in AMBER, initiating therapy with the D/C/F/TAF single-tablet regimen was an effective and well-tolerated option, regardless of demographic or clinical characteristics.", "meta": {"pmid": 31303147}}

In this open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study, 14 patients with type 1 diabetes received once-daily, individualized, stable BIL or GL doses for 3\u2009weeks. Palmitate flux was assessed using [9,10-3 H]palmitate infusion. VLDL-TG secretion, clearance and oxidation rate were assessed using primed-constant infusion of ex vivo labelled [1-14 C]VLDL-TG, while VLDL-TG storage rate was assessed using [9,10-3 H]VLDL-TG bolus injection. The VLDL-TG concentration and secretion rate, and palmitate flux were statistically significantly higher during BIL than during GL treatment (58%, 51% and 35%, respectively). The ratios of least squares (LS) geometric means for VLDL-TG clearance and oxidation were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.17) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.91, 1.90), respectively. The difference in LS means for VLDL-TG storage rate was -0.36 (95% CI -0.83, 0.12). BIL-treated patients had higher effective lipolysis, VLDL-TG secretion and VLDL-TG concentration compared with GL-treated patients, explaining the increased plasma TG concentrations reported previously.

{"text": "Centrioles form centrosomes and cilia, and defects in any of these three organelles are associated with human disease [1]. Centrioles duplicate once per cell cycle, when a mother centriole assembles an adjacent daughter during S phase. Daughter centrioles cannot support the assembly of another daughter until they mature into mothers during the next cell cycle [2-5]. The molecular nature of this daughter-to-mother transition remains mysterious. Pioneering studies in C. elegans identified a set of core proteins essential for centriole duplication [6-12], and a similar set have now been identified in other species [10, 13-18]. The protein kinase ZYG-1/Sak/Plk4 recruits the inner centriole cartwheel components SAS-6 and SAS-5/Ana2/STIL, which then recruit SAS-4/CPAP, which in turn helps assemble the outer centriole microtubules [19, 20]. In flies and humans, the Asterless/Cep152 protein interacts with Sak/Plk4 and Sas-4/CPAP and is required for centriole duplication, although its precise role in the assembly pathway is unclear [21-24]. Here, we show that Asl is not incorporated into daughter centrioles as they assemble during S phase but is only incorporated once mother and daughter separate at the end of mitosis. The initial incorporation of Asterless (Asl) is irreversible, requires DSas-4, and, crucially, is essential for daughter centrioles to mature into mothers that can support centriole duplication. We therefore propose a \"dual-licensing\" model of centriole duplication, in which Asl incorporation provides a permanent primary license to allow new centrioles to duplicate for the first time, while centriole disengagement provides a reduplication license to allow mother centrioles to duplicate again.", "meta": {"pmid": 24835456}}
{"text": "Close homologue of L1 (CHL1) is a cell recognition molecule known to promote axonal growth in vitro. We have investigated the expression of CHL1 mRNA by regenerating central nervous system (CNS) neurons, by using in situ hybridisation 3 days to 10 weeks following the implantation of living and freeze-killed peripheral nerve autografts into the thalamus of adult rats. At all survival times after implantation of living grafts, neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), close to the graft tip and up to 1 mm away from it, displayed strong signal for CHL1 mRNA, even though TRN neurons show very low levels of CHL1 mRNA expression in unoperated animals. When the cell bodies of regenerating neurons were identified by retrograde labelling from the distal portion of the grafts, 4-6 weeks after operation, most of the labelled cells were found in the TRN and could be shown to haveupregulated CHL1 mRNA. In addition, some neurons in dorsal thalamic nuclei near the graft tip transiently upregulated CHL1 mRNA during the first 3 weeks after graft implantation, and glial cells showing CHL1 mRNA expression were present at the brain/graft interface 3 days to 2 weeks after operation. Freeze-killed grafts, into which axons do not regenerate, caused a transient upregulation of CHL1 in very few TRN neurons near the graft tip and in glial cells at the brain/graft interface but did not produce prolonged CHL1 mRNA expression. CHL1 can therefore be added to the list of molecules (including GAP-43, L1, and c-jun) strongly expressed by CNS neurons that regenerate their axons into nerve grafts, but not by those neurons that fail to regenerate their axons.", "meta": {"pmid": 10972939}}

Even though pharmacokinetic data regarding such interaction are available, they cannot be used for quantitative prediction. For this reason, we aimed to develop a pharmacokinetic model for predicting the magnitude of inhibition of simvastatin metabolism by itraconazole. Published data involving pharmacokinetic of simvastatin, itraconazole, and pharmacokinetic interaction between simvastatin and itraconazole were selected from PubMed search. Serum simvastatin concentrations were subsequently extracted and used for model development. Advanced Continuous Simulating Language Extreme (ACSLX) was used for modeling. The drug-drug interaction model between simvastatin and itraconazole was simultaneously modeled using a one compartment parent-metabolite model for simvastatin, and a two-compartment model for itraconazole. The final drug-drug interaction model can adequately describe the actual simvastatin concentrations.

{"text": "FGD1 gene mutations result in faciogenital dysplasia (FGDY, Aarskog syndrome), an X-linked developmental disorder that adversely affects the formation of multiple skeletal structures. FGD1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates the Rho GTPase Cdc42. By way of Cdc42, FGD1 regulates the actin cytoskeleton and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling cascade to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Previous work shows that FGD1 is the founding member of a family of related genes including the mouse Fgd2 gene and the rat Frabin gene. Here, we report on the isolation, characterization, and mapping of the mouse Fgd3 gene, a new and novel member of the FGD1 gene family. Fgd3 cDNA encodes a 733-amino-acid protein with a predicted mass of 81 kDa. Fgd3 and FGD1 share a high degree of sequence identity that spans >560 contiguous amino acid residues. Like FGD1, Fgd3 contains adjacent RhoGEF and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a second carboxy-terminal PH domain, and a distinctive FYVE domain. Together, these domains appear to form a canonical core structure for FGD1 family members. In addition, compared to other FGD1 family members, Fgd3 contains different structural regions that may be involved in distinct signaling interactions. Microinjection studies show that Fgd3 stimulates fibroblasts to form filopodia, actin microspikes formed upon the stimulation of Cdc42. Fgd3 transcripts are present in several diverse tissues and during mouse embryogenesis, suggesting a developmentally regulated pattern of expression and a potential role in embryonic development. Genetic linkage and radiation hybrid mapping data show that Fgd3 and the human FGD3 ortholog map to syntenic regions of murine chromosome 13 and human chromosome 9q22, respectively. We conclude that Fgd3 is a new and novel member of the FGD1 family of RhoGEF proteins.", "meta": {"pmid": 10721717}}

Participants completed measures about pre-WLS food addiction (YFAS), emotional and binge eating, behavioral activation and inhibition, and pre- and post-WLS substance use. A sample of 67 WLS patients (59.7% Roux-en-Y) was recruited; participants were 62.7% female, 86.6% Caucasian, had a mean age of 42.7; and 53.7% met the criteria for pre-WLS food addiction. Convergent validity was found between the YFAS and measures of emotional eating (r=.368, p<.05) and binge eating (r=.469, p<.05). Discriminant validity was supported in that problematic substance use, behavioral activation, and behavioral inhibition were not associated with YFAS scores. Incremental validity was supported in that the YFAS explained a significant proportion of additional variance in binge eating scores, beyond that predicted by emotional eating (EES) and disordered eating behavior (EAT-26). Those meeting the food addiction criteria had poorer percent total weight loss outcomes (32% vs. 27%). There was a nonsignificant trend towards those with higher food addiction being more likely to admit to post-WLS problematic substance use (i.e., potential \"addiction transfer\"; 53% vs. 39%).

Unfortunately, few studies exist describing the impact of real-time antifungal susceptibility testing on the treatment of invasive fungal infections. Newer antifungal agents with broader anti-Candida activity, fewer adverse events and minimal resistance are currently available. The challenge clinicians face is choosing when to use these agents appropriately, while considering the changing Candida epidemiology and susceptibility trends without over-treating fluconazole-sensitive pathogens.

Rare Mendelian myopathy disorders of human SGCD occur, although common naturally occurring SGCD genetic variation has not been evaluated for effects on human norepinephrine (NE) secretion. This study investigated the effect of SGCD genetic variation on control of NE secretion in healthy twin pairs. Genetic associations profiled SNPs across the SGCD locus. Trait heritability (h(2)) and genetic covariance (pleiotropy; shared h(2)) were evaluated. Sympathochromaffin exocytosis in vivo was probed in plasma by both catecholamines and Chromogranin B (CHGB). Plasma NE is substantially heritable (p = 3.19E-16, at 65.2 \u00b1 5.0% of trait variance), sharing significant (p < 0.05) genetic determination with circulating and urinary catecholamines, CHGB, eGFR, and several cardio-metabolic traits. Participants with higher pNE showed significant (p < 0.05) differences in several traits, including increased BP and hypertension risk factors. Peak SGCD variant rs1835919 predicted elevated systemic vascular compliance, without changes in specifically myocardial traits. We used a chimeric-regulated secretory pathway photoprotein (CHGA-EAP) to evaluate the effect of SGCD on the exocytotic pathway in transfected PC12 cells; in transfected cells, expression of SGCD augmented CHGA trafficking into the exocytotic regulated secretory pathway. Thus, our investigation determined human NE secretion to be a highly heritable trait, influenced by common genetic variation within the SGCD locus. Circulating NE aggregates with BP and hypertension risk factors. In addition, coordinate NE and CHGB elevation by rs1835919 implicates exocytosis as the mechanism of release.", "meta": {"pmid": 23786442}}

She had received anticoagulant therapy with warfarin due to chronic atrial fibrillation and PT-INR was well controlled between 1.6-2.2. When she presented, PT-INR was 12.88, and urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypoalbuminemia (2.2 g/dl) were observed. Therefore, warfarin therapy was discontinued, and antibiotics and vitamin K were administered. Normalization of PT-INR resulted in the disappearance of hematuria and UTI improved as a result of antibiotics administration. As the appetite loss improved, for serum albumin level increased. The previous dose of warfarin achieved PT-INR around 1.8. Her drug compliance had been good, and she took no drug nor food which could interact with warfarin. We also found no liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, malignancy, nor hyper- or hypo-thyroidism. Hypoalbuminemia caused by appetite loss due to UTI seems very likely to increase concentration of circulating free warfarin resulting in extreme prolongation of PT-INR. Our findings in the present case may suggest that we should pay more attention on changes of drug pharmacokinetics in elderly patients because of their poor adaptation to their circumstances such as infection or dehydration.", "meta": {"pmid": 20139651}}

Here we review progress in mapping RXFP1, RXFP2, and RXFP3 (mRNAs and proteins) and their respective ligands and discuss some of the putative functions for these peptides and receptors that are being explored using receptor-selective agonist and antagonist peptides and receptor and peptide gene deletion mouse strains. Comparative studies reveal an association of RXFP1 and RXFP2 with excitatory neurons but a differential regional or cellular distribution, in contrast to the association of RXFP3 with inhibitory neurons. These studies also reveal differences in the distribution of RXFP1 and RXFP2 in rat and mouse brain, whereas the distribution of RXFP3 is more conserved across these species. Enrichment of RXFP1/2/3 in olfactory, cortical, thalamic, limbic, hypothalamic, midbrain, and pontine circuits suggests a diverse range of modulatory actions for these receptors. For example, experimental evidence in the rat reveals that RXFP1 activation in the amygdala inhibits memory consolidation, RXFP2 activation in striatum produces sniffing behavior, and RXFP3 modulation has effects on feeding and metabolism, the activity of the septohippocampal pathway, and spatial memory. Further studies are now required to reveal additional details of these and other functions linked to relaxin family peptide receptor signaling in mammalian brain and the precise mechanisms involved.", "meta": {"pmid": 19416194}}

{"text": "Antihistamines constitute the first line of therapy for allergic conjunctivitis, and are safe and effective in relieving the signs and symptoms of ocular allergy. Despite this, they are less effective than some other drugs in relieving delayed symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Recent evidence suggests that changes in the conjunctival epithelium may underlie aspects of delayed reactions. In this study we compared two antihistamines, olopatadine and alcaftadine, for their ability to modify epithelial cell changes associated with allergic conjunctivitis at time points selected to reflect late-phase reactions. Studies employed a modified conjunctival allergen challenge model. Sensitized mice were challenged with topical allergen with or without drug treatments. Treatment groups were assayed for acute-phase (15 minutes) and delayed-phase (24 hours) responses. Groups were scored for allergy symptoms (redness, itch, tearing, and edema) and for conjunctival mast cell numbers. Delayed-phase groups were also examined for eosinophil numbers and for tight junctional protein expression. Olopatadine-treated and alcaftadine-treated animals had similar efficacy profiles and mast cell numbers, suggesting both were effective at ameliorating symptoms of the acute phase. In contrast, alcaftadine-treated animals had significantly lower conjunctival eosinophil infiltration than either controls or olopatadine-treated animals. Allergen challenge caused a significant decrease in expression of the junctional protein, ZO-1, and this decrease was prevented by alcaftadine but not by olopatadine. Alcaftadine displays therapeutic properties beyond its antihistamine action. These include an ability to reduce conjunctival eosinophil recruitment, and a protective effect on epithelial tight junction protein expression.", "meta": {"pmid": 21340041}}

RT-qPCR and western blot assays were employed to detect gene expression. Colony formation, EdU, JC-1, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays were implemented to explore the function of circ_NEK6 on biological activities of NSCLC cells.

Functionally, the silencing of circ_NEK6 could effectively suppress NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Circ_NEK6 sequestered miR-382-5p to fortify the expression of breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) in NSCLC. Besides, BCAS2 had tumor-promoting function in NSCLC. Furthermore, the effects of down-regulated circ_NEK6 on the malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells were totally recovered by miR-382-5p inhibition or BCAS2 overexpression.

Egr1 regulates luteinizing hormone beta subunit (LHbeta) gene expression in the pituitary gland. Due to decreased levels of LHbeta, female Egr1-deficient mice are anovulatory, have low levels of progesterone, and are infertile. By contrast, male mutant mice show no identifiable defects in spermatogenesis, testosterone synthesis, or fertility. Here, we have shown that serum LH levels in male Egr1-deficient mice are adequate for maintenance of Leydig cell steroidogenesis and fertility because of partial functional redundancy with the closely related transcription factor Egr4. Egr4-Egr1 double mutant male mice had low steady-state levels of serum LH, physiologically low serum levels of testosterone, and atrophy of androgen-dependent organs that were not present in either Egr1- or Egr4-deficient males. In double mutant male mice, atrophic androgen-dependent organs and Leydig cell steroidogenesis were fully restored by administration of exogenous testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (an LH receptor agonist), respectively. Moreover, a normal distribution of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-containing neurons and normal innervation of the median eminence in the hypothalamus, as well as decreased levels of LH gene expression in Egr4-Egr1-relative to Egr1-deficient male mice, indicates a defect of LH regulation in pituitary gonadotropes.

However, problems remain with issues such as acquisition of chemoresistance against GEM. GEM is activated after phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) inside of the cell; thus, DCK inactivation is one of the important mechanisms for acquisition of GEM resistance. We previously investigated the DCK gene in multiple GEM resistant cancer cell lines and identified frequent inactivating mutations. In this study, we identified two crucial genetic alteration in DCK. (1) A total deletion of DCK in RTGBC1-TKB, an acquired GEM resistant cell line derived from a gall bladder cancer cell line TGBC1-TKB. (2) An E197K missense alteration of DCK in MKN28, a gastric cancer cell line; its acquired GEM resistant cancer cell line, RMKN28, showed a loss of the normal E197 allele. We introduced either normal DCK or altered DCK_E197K into RMKN28 and proved that only the introduction of normal DCK restored GEM sensitivity. Furthermore, we analyzed 104 healthy volunteers and found that none of them carried the same base substitution observed in MKN28. These results strongly suggest that (1) the E197K alteration in DCK causes inactivation of DCK, and that (2) loss of the normal E197 allele is the crucial mechanism in acquisition of GEM resistance in RMKN28.

The promoter of sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein 2 (SSBP2) was methylated in the Het-1A cells exposed to MSE (MSE-Het-1A). Promoter methylation (86%, 56/70) and downregulation of SSBP2 expression were frequently detected in tumor tissues from ESCC patients. In addition, reintroduction of SSBP2 in an ESCC cell line (TE1) that does not express SSBP2 and in the MSE-Het-1A cells inhibited expression of LRP6 and Dvl3, which are mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway. SSBP2 expression markedly decreased the colony-forming ability of ESCC cell lines and significantly inhibited cell growth of the MSE-Het-1A cells.

{"text": "Although left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is often associated with hypertension, little is known regarding its underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Here, we show that the actin cytoskeletal regulator, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase-2 (ROCK2), is a critical mediator of LV diastolic dysfunction. In response to angiotensin II (Ang II), mutant mice with fibroblast-specific deletion of ROCK2 (ROCK2Postn-/-) developed less LV wall thickness and fibrosis, along with improved isovolumetric relaxation. This corresponded with decreased connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) expression in the hearts of ROCK2Postn-/- mice. Indeed, knockdown of ROCK2 in cardiac fibroblasts leads to decreased expression of CTGF and secretion of FGF2, and cardiomyocytes incubated with conditioned media from ROCK2-knockdown cardiac fibroblasts exhibited less hypertrophic response. In contrast, mutant mice with elevated fibroblast ROCK activity exhibited enhanced Ang II-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Clinically, higher leukocyte ROCK2 activity was observed in patients with diastolic dysfunction compared with age- and sex-matched controls, and correlated with higher grades of diastolic dysfunction by echocardiography. These findings indicate that fibroblast ROCK2 is necessary to cause cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis through the induction CTGF and FGF2, and they suggest that targeting ROCK2 may have therapeutic benefits in patients with LV diastolic dysfunction.", "meta": {"pmid": 28679962}}
{"text": "The availability of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of lipid abnormalities in patients at risk for the development of coronary atherosclerosis. The relatively widespread experience with HMG-CoA therapy has allowed a clear picture to emerge concerning the relative tolerability of these agents. While HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to decrease complications from atherosclerosis and to improve total mortality, concern has been raised as to the long term safety of these agents. They came under close scrutiny in early trials because ocular complications had been seen with older inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. However, extensive evaluation demonstrated no significant adverse alteration of ophthalmological function by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Extensive experience with the potential adverse effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on hepatic function has accumulated. The effect on hepatic function for the various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is roughly dose-related and 1 to 3% of patients experience an increase in hepatic enzyme levels. The majority of liver abnormalities occur within the first 3 months of therapy and require monitoring. Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon syndrome and occurs in approximately 0.1% of patients who receive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor monotherapy. However, the incidence is increased when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used in combination with agents that share a common metabolic path. The role of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system in drug-drug interactions involving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been extensively studied. Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin are predominantly metabolised by the CYP3A4 isozyme. Fluvastatin has several metabolic pathways which involve the CYP enzyme system. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by this enzyme and thus has theoretical advantage in combination therapy. The major interactions with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in combination therapy involving rhabdomyolysis include fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, cyclosporin and fluconazole. Additional concern has been raised relative to overzealous lowering of cholesterol which could occur due to the potency of therapy with these agents. Currently, there is no evidence from clinical trials of an increase in cardiovascular or total mortality associated with potent low density lipoprotein reduction.

Recent studies have shown that peripheral administration of Oxt suppresses feeding and, when infused subchronically, ameliorates hyperphagic obesity. However, the route through which peripheral Oxt informs the brain is obscure. This study aimed to explore whether vagal afferents mediate the sensing and anorexigenic effect of peripherally injected Oxt in mice. Intraperitoneal Oxt injection suppressed food intake and increased c-Fos expression in nucleus tractus solitarius to which vagal afferents project. The Oxt-induced feeding suppression and c-Fos expression in nucleus tractus solitarius were blunted in mice whose vagal afferent nerves were blocked by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or capsaicin treatment. Oxt induced membrane depolarization and increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in single vagal afferent neurons. The Oxt-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases were markedly suppressed by Oxt receptor antagonist. These Oxt-responsive neurons also responded to cholecystokinin-8 and contained cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript. In obese diabetic db/db mice, leptin failed to increase, but Oxt increased [Ca(2+)]i in vagal afferent neurons, and single or subchronic infusion of Oxt decreased food intake and body weight gain.

{"text": "Neurosteroids regulate GABA-A receptor plasticity. Neurosteroid withdrawal occurs during menstruation and is associated with a marked increase in expression of GABA-A receptor \u03b14-subunit, a key subunit linked to enhanced neuronal excitability, seizure susceptibility and benzodiazepine resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the upregulation of \u03b14-subunit expression remain unclear. Here we utilized the progesterone receptor (PR) knockout mouse to investigate molecular pathways of PR and the transcription factor early growth response factor-3 (Egr3) in regulation of the GABA-A receptor \u03b14-subunit expression in the hippocampus in a mouse neurosteroid withdrawal paradigm. Neurosteroid withdrawal induced a threefold increase in \u03b14-subunit expression in wild-type mice, but this upregulation was unchanged in PR knockout mice. The expression of Egr3, which controls \u03b14-subunit transcription, was increased significantly following neurosteroid withdrawal in wild-type and PR knockout mice. Neurosteroid withdrawal-induced \u03b14-subunit upregulation was completely suppressed by antisense Egr3 inhibition. In the hippocampus kindling model of epilepsy, there was heightened seizure activity, significant reduction in the antiseizure sensitivity of diazepam (a benzodiazepine insensitive at \u03b14\u03b2\u03b3-receptors) and conferral of increased seizure protection of flumazenil (a low-affinity agonist at \u03b14\u03b2\u03b3-receptors) in neurosteroid-withdrawn wild-type and PR knockout mice. These observations are consistent with enhanced \u03b14-containing receptor abundance in vivo. Neurosteroid withdrawal-induced seizure exacerbation, diazepam insensitivity, and flumazenil efficacy in the kindling model were reversed by inhibition of Egr3. These results indicate that neurosteroid withdrawal-induced upregulation of GABA-A receptor \u03b14-subunit expression is mediated by the Egr3 via a PR-independent signaling pathway.

They modulate many metabolic processes such as lipolysis, thermogenesis and TAG storage in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), as well as fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis in the liver. To understand the evolutionary process of Cide proteins and provide insight into the role of Cide proteins as potential metabolic regulators in various species, we searched various databases and performed comparative genomic analysis to study the sequence conservation, genomic structure, and phylogenetic tree of the CIDE-N and CIDE-C domains of Cide proteins. As a result, we identified signature sequences for the N-terminal region of Dffa, Dffb and Cide proteins and CIDE-C domain of Cide proteins, and observed that sequences homologous to CIDE-N domain displays a wide phylogenetic distribution in species ranging from lower organisms such as hydra (Hydra vulgaris) and sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) to mammals, whereas the CIDE-C domain exists only in vertebrates. Further analysis of their genomic structures showed that although evolution of the ancestral CIDE-N domain had undergone different intron insertions to various positions in the domain among invertebrates, the genomic structure of Cide family in vertebrates is stable with conserved intron phase. Based on our analysis, we speculate that in early vertebrates CIDE-N domain was evolved from the duplication of NCD of Dffa. The CIDE-N domain somehow acquired the CIDE-C domain that was formed around the same time, subsequently generating the Cide protein. Subsequent duplication and evolution have led to the formation of different Cide family proteins that play unique roles in the control of metabolic pathways in different tissues.", "meta": {"pmid": 18500987}}

Among recombinant P450 enzymes, CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B catalyzed mainly the omega-hydroxylation of C18-epoxides with an apparent Vmax of between 0.84 and 15.0 min(-1), whereas the apparent Vmax displayed by CYP4F3A, the isoform found in leukocytes, ranged from 3.0 to 21.2 min(-1). The rate of omega-hydroxylation by CYP4A11 was experimentally found to be between 0.3 and 2.7 min(-1). CYP4F2 and CYP4F3 exhibited preferences for omega-hydroxylation of Z 8(9)-EET, whereas human liver microsomes preferred Z 11(12)-EET and, to a lesser extent, Z 8(9)-EET. Moreover, vicinal diol from both C18-epoxides and EETs were omega-hydroxylated by liver microsomes and by CYP4F2 and CYP4F3.

{"text": "Accumulating evidence indicates that COX-2 inhibitors are involved in colon and breast cancer development. Our previous studies indicated that nimesulide and celecoxib, selective COX-2 inhibitors, show inhibitory effects of intestinal carcinogenesis in azoxymethane-treated rats and mice and in Min mice models. We recently found that nimesulide suppressed PhIP-induced breast cancer in female SD rats in which COX-2 protein was overexpressed. These results led us to investigate the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the target tissues. PGE2 showed its biological activity through binding to its membrane receptors, EP(1 to approximately 4). We also investigated the effects of EP receptors on colon carcinogenesis. We used receptor knockout mice and selective receptor antagonists. Our results indicated that the EP1 receptor plays a pivotal role in colon carcinogenesis.

{"text": "The sorting of signaling receptors into and out of cilia relies on the BBSome, a complex of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, and on the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. GTP loading onto the Arf-like GTPase ARL6/BBS3 drives assembly of a membrane-apposed BBSome coat that promotes cargo entry into cilia, yet how and where ARL6 is activated remains elusive. Here, we show that the Rab-like GTPase IFT27/RABL4, a known component of IFT complex B, promotes the exit of BBSome and associated cargoes from cilia. Unbiased proteomics and biochemical reconstitution assays show that, upon disengagement from the rest of IFT-B, IFT27 directly interacts with the nucleotide-free form of ARL6. Furthermore, IFT27 prevents aggregation of nucleotide-free ARL6 in solution. Thus, we propose that IFT27 separates from IFT-B inside cilia to promote ARL6 activation, BBSome coat assembly, and subsequent ciliary exit, mirroring the process by which BBSome mediates cargo entry into cilia.

{"text": "The accuracy of genotype imputation depends upon two factors: the sample size of the reference panel and the genetic similarity between the reference panel and the target samples. When multiple reference panels are not consented to combine together, it is unclear how to combine the imputation results to optimize the power of genetic association studies. We compared the accuracy of 9,265 Norwegian genomes imputed from three reference panels-1000 Genomes phase 3 (1000G), Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC), and a reference panel containing 2,201 Norwegian participants from the population-based Nord Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) from low-pass genome sequencing. We observed that the population-matched reference panel allowed for imputation of more population-specific variants with lower frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) between 0.05% and 0.5%). The overall imputation accuracy from the population-specific panel was substantially higher than 1000G and was comparable with HRC, despite HRC being 15-fold larger. These results recapitulate the value of population-specific reference panels for genotype imputation. We also evaluated different strategies to utilize multiple sets of imputed genotypes to increase the power of association studies. We observed that testing association for all variants imputed from any panel results in higher power to detect association than the alternative strategy of including only one version of each genetic variant, selected for having the highest imputation quality metric. This was particularly true for lower frequency variants (MAF\u00a0<\u00a01%), even after adjusting for the additional multiple testing burden.", "meta": {"pmid": 28861891}}
{"text": "Cisapride, a prokinetic agent, has been used for the treatment of a number of gastrointestinal disorders, particularly gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in adults and children. Since 1993, 341 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, including 80 deaths, have been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration. Marketing of the drug has now been discontinued in the US; however, it is still available under a limited-access protocol. Knowledge of the risk factors for cisapride-associated arrhythmias will be essential for its continued use in those patients who meet the eligibility criteria. This review summarises the published literature on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of cisapride with concomitantly administered drugs, providing clinicians with practical recommendations for avoiding these potentially fatal events. Pharmacokinetic interactions with cisapride involve inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, the primary mode of elimination of cisapride, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the drug. The macrolide antibacterials clarithromycin, erythromycin and troleandomycin are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and should not be used in conjunction with cisapride. Azithromycin is an alternative. Similarly, azole antifungal agents such as fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole are CYP3A4 inhibitors and their concomitant use with cisapride should be avoided. Of the antidepressants nefazodone and fluvoxamine should be avoided with cisapride. Data with fluoxetine is controversial, we favour the avoidance of its use. Citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline are alternatives. The HIV protease inhibitors amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir inhibit CYP3A4. Clinical experience with cisapride is lacking but avoidance with all protease inhibitors is recommended, although saquinavir is thought to have clinically insignificant effects on CYP3A4. Delavirdine is also a CYP3A4 inhibitor and should be avoided with cisapride. We also recommend avoiding coadministration of cisapride with amiodarone, cimetidine (alternatives are famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine or one of the proton pump inhibitors), diltiazem and verapamil (the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are alternatives), grapefruit juice, isoniazid, metronidazole, quinine, quinupristin/dalfopristin and zileuton (montelukast is an alternative). Pharmacodynamic interactions with cisapride involve drugs that have the potential to have additive effects on the QT interval. We do not recommend use of cisapride with class Ia and III antiarrhythmic drugs or with adenosine, bepridil, cyclobenzaprine, droperidol, haloperidol, nifedipine (immediate release), phenothiazine antipsychotics, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants or vasopressin. Vigilance is advised if anthracyclines, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), enflurane, halothane, isoflurane, pentamidine or probucol are used with cisapride. In addition, uncorrected electrolyte disturbances induced by diuretics may increase the risk of torsade de pointes. Patients receiving cisapride should be promptly treated for electrolyte disturbances.", "meta": {"pmid": 10926350}}
{"text": "Repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of expanded repeat mutation mRNA produces toxic peptides in neurons of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings indicate that RAN translation in diverse model systems is not inhibited by cellular stressors that impair global translation through phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2, the essential eukaryotic translation initiation factor that brings the initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosome. Using in vitro, cell-based, and Drosophila models, we examined the role of alternative ternary complex factors that may function in place of eIF2, including eIF2A, eIF2D, DENR, and MCTS1. Among these factors, DENR knockdown had the greatest inhibitory effect on RAN translation of expanded GGGGCC and CGG repeat reporters, and its reduction improved survival of Drosophila expressing expanded GGGGCC repeats. Taken together, these data support a role for alternative initiation factors in RAN translation and suggest these may serve as novel therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative disease.", "meta": {"pmid": 35220421}}

We evaluated imputation accuracy in CH (N = 1,000), focusing on rare (0.1% \u2264 minor allele frequency (MAF) \u2264 1%) and ultra-rare (MAF < 0.1%) variants. We used two reference panels, the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC; N = 27,165) and 1000 Genome Project (1000G phase 3; N = 2,504) and multiple phasing (SHAPEIT, Eagle2) and imputation algorithms (IMPUTE2, MACH-Admix). To assess imputation quality, we reported: (a) high-quality variant counts according to imputation tools' internal indexes (e.g., IMPUTE2 \"Info\" \u2265 80%). (b) Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test comparing imputation quality for genotyped variants that were masked and imputed; (c) Cohen's kappa coefficient to test agreement between imputed and whole-exome sequencing (WES) variants; (d) imputation of G206A mutation in the PSEN1 (ultra-rare in the general population an more frequent in CH) followed by confirmation genotyping. We also tested ancestry proportion (European, African and Native American) against WES-imputation mismatches in a Poisson regression fashion. SHAPEIT2 retrieved higher percentage of imputed high-quality variants than Eagle2 (rare: 51.02% vs. 48.60%; ultra-rare 0.66% vs. 0.65%, Wilcoxon p-value < 0.001). SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 employing HRC outperformed 1000G (64.50% vs. 59.17%; 1.69% vs. 0.75% for high-quality rare and ultra-rare variants, respectively, Wilcoxon p-value < 0.001). SHAPEIT-IMPUTE2 outperformed MaCH-Admix. Compared to 1000G, HRC-imputation retrieved a higher number of high-quality rare and ultra-rare variants, despite showing lower agreement between imputed and WES variants (e.g., rare: 98.86% for HRC vs. 99.02% for 1000G). High Kappa (K = 0.99) was observed for both reference panels. Twelve G206A mutation carriers were imputed and all validated by confirmation genotyping. African ancestry was associated with higher imputation errors for uncommon and rare variants (p-value < 1e-05). Reference panels with larger numbers of haplotypes can improve imputation quality for rare and ultra-rare variants in admixed populations such as CH.

{"text": "Craniofacial morphogenesis is a complex multi-step process that involves numerous biological processes to coordinate the growth, proliferation, migration, and subsequent differentiation of the cranial neural crest cells. Members of the Fibronectin Leucine-Rich Transmembrane (Flrt) gene family have been previously reported to be widely expressed in the developing embryo. We mapped the expression of Flrt2 and Flrt3 at critical stages of craniofacial development and found that, during early craniofacial development, Flrt2 was highly expressed initially in the cranial neural crest cells and Flrt3 in the midbrain. Later both genes were expressed in the developing pharyngeal region. Flrt2 expression predominated in the neural crest-derived mesenchyme in the medial aspect of the developing frontonasal region in close relationships with the expression of Fgfr2, Shh, and Msx1, three genes shown previously to play critical roles in craniofacial development. Flrt2 was also present in the vomero-nasal organ, mandibular primodia, and the posterior aspects of the unfused and fused secondary palatal shelves. Flrt3, however, had a more restrictive expression, being present in the mesenchyme underlying the ectoderm of the medial nasal process and in the mandibular primordium and in regions undergoing outgrowth, in a pattern that overlapped with Bmp4 expression. Both Flrt2 and Flrt3 were later found to be present at sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions such as the developing tooth buds, hair follicles, and eye.

{"text": "The primary cilium, a solitary protrusion from most mammalian cells, functions as a cell sensor by receiving extracellular signals through receptors and channels accumulated in the organelle. Certain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) specifically localize to the membrane compartment of primary cilia. To gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate ciliary GPCR sorting, we investigated the atypical small GTPase RAB-like 2 (RABL2; herein referring to the near-identical human paralogs RABL2A and RABL2B). RABL2 recruitment to the mother centriole is dependent on the distal appendage proteins CEP164 and CEP83. We found that silencing of RABL2 causes mis-targeting of ciliary GPCRs, GPR161 and HTR6, whereas overexpression of RABL2 resulted in accumulation of these receptors in the organelle. Ablation of CEP19 and the intraflagellar transport B (IFT-B) complex, which interact with RABL2, also leads to mis-localization of GPR161. RABL2 controls localization of GPR161 independently of TULP3, which promotes entry of ciliary GPCRs. We further demonstrate that RABL2 physically associates with ciliary GPCRs. Taken together, these studies suggest that RABL2 plays an important role in trafficking of ciliary GPCRs at the ciliary base in mammalian cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 30578315}}

{"text": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are widely prescribed to pregnant women suffering with depression, although the long-term impact of these medications on exposed offspring are poorly understood. Perinatal SSRI exposure alters human offspring's neurodevelopment and increases risk for psychiatric illness in later life. Rodent studies suggest that perinatal SSRI-induced behavioral abnormalities are driven by changes in the serotonin system as well as epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in the developing hippocampus. A major gene altered by perinatal SSRI exposure is the G-protein coupled receptor Brain Angiogenesis Inhibitor 3 (BAI3). Our present study shows that perinatal exposure to the SSRI citalopram increases mRNA expression of Bai3 and related molecules (including its C1ql ligands) in the early postnatal dentate gyrus of male and female offspring. Transient Bai3 mRNA knockdown in perinatal SSRI-exposed dentate gyrus lessened behavioral consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure, leading to increased active stress coping. To determine translational implications of this work, we examined expression of BAI3 and related molecules in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex from patients that suffered with depression or schizophrenia relative to healthy control subjects. We found sex- and region-specific changes in mRNA expression of BAI3 and its ligands C1QL2 and C1QL3 in men and women with a history of psychiatric disorders compared to healthy controls.

SFK inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib, which enhance ATRA-induced differentiation, were used to evaluate the involvement of Lyn kinase activity in CD38-driven signaling. Cells treated with ATRA for 48h followed by one hour of PP2 incubation show SFK/Lyn kinase inhibition. We observed that Lyn inhibition blocked c-Cbl and p85/p55 PI3K phosphorylation driven by the anti-CD38 agonistic mAb IB4 in ATRA-treated HL-60 cells and untreated CD38+ transfectants. In contrast, cells cultured for 48h following concurrent ATRA and PP2 treatment did not show Lyn inhibition, suggesting ATRA regulates the effects on Lyn. 48h of co-treatment preserved CD38-stimulated c-Cbl and p85/p55 PI3K phosphorylation indicating Lyn kinase activity is necessary for these events. In contrast another SFK inhibitor (dasatinib) which blocks Lyn activity with ATRA co-treatment prevented ATRA-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation and crippled p85 PI3K phosphorylation, indicating Lyn kinase activity is important for ATRA-propelled events potentially regulated by CD38. We found that loss of Lyn activity coincided with a decrease in Vav1/Lyn/CD38 and SLP-76/Lyn/CD38 interaction, suggesting these molecules form a complex that regulates CD38 signaling. Lyn inhibition also reduced Lyn and CD38 binding to p85 PI3K, indicating CD38 facilitates a complex responsible for PI3K phosphorylation.

The effects of pH and different organic matter characteristics on the photodegradation of cimetidine (CMT), propranolol (PRP), and carbamazepine (CBZ) were investigated. The pH-dependence of the photocatalytic degradation rates of PRP was explained by electrostatic interactions between the selected compounds and the surface of TiO2 NFs. The degradation rates of CMT showed the following order: deionized water > l-tyrosine > secondary wastewater effluent (effluent organic matter) > Suwannee River natural organic matter, demonstrating that the characteristics of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) can affect the photodegradation of CMT. Photodegradation of CBZ was affected by the presence of DOM, and no significant change was observed between different DOM characteristics.

Three out of 15 cases in this series, had a heterotopic pregnancy who were treated by transvaginal ultrasound-guided injection of KCL. Others received systemic MTX injection in four cases, and local MTX injection in eight cases under either laparoscopy or transvaginal ultrasound guidance. Four different protocols of MTX (Ledertrexate) administration was performed in this series with time: at the beginning of our experience, MTX1 protocol, 15 mg i.m. daily for 5 days was used; and after MTX2 protocol, 1 mg/kg body weight i.m. daily for 4 days; MTX3 protocol, 1 mg/kg body weight intratubal associated with 1 mg/kg body weight i.m. daily for 3 days; and now MTX4 protocol, only intratubal 1 mg/kg body weight is especially used. The success was defined as declining serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to undetectable levels, and no further surgical management was required. Outcome of subsequent fertility was also evaluated. Complete resolution was obtained in 13 (86.6%) out of 15 interstitial pregnancies. Two out of 15 patients, with medical treatment's failure required secondary surgery. No severe side effects of medical treatment were observed. Follow-up hysterosalpingography was performed in 12 patients showing 91.7% tubal patency on the side of interstitial pregnancy. Outcome of intra-uterine pregnancy of the three patients who had heterotopic gestation, was two miscarriages and one delivery at term. Out of the other 12 patients in this series, nine became pregnant within 1 year: eight pregnancies at term, and one induced abortion. At present, among the last three patients, two have no desire to conceive. Our results suggest that unruptured interstitial pregnancies now can be managed with local MTX administration of 1 mg/kg body weight under transvaginal ultrasound or under laparoscopy procedure. This approach is particularly attractive in these patients, where the only alternative to therapy is laparotomy with cornual resection.", "meta": {"pmid": 9119095}}
{"text": "The pathophysiology of diabetes has historically focused on alterations in insulin secretion and function; however, diabetes involves multiple hormonal alterations, including abnormal regulation of amylin. This review discusses the physiologic functions of amylin in glucose homeostasis and the rationale for amylin replacement in type 1 and 2 diabetes. The use of pramlintide, a synthetic amylin analog, is also discussed. Amylin, formed primarily in pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells, is cosecreted with insulin in response to caloric intake. Patients with type 1 diabetes have lower baseline amylin serum concentrations, and amylin response to caloric intake is absent. Patients with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin also have a diminished amylin response to caloric intake, potentially related to the degree of \u03b2-cell impairment. Key physiologic functions of amylin in maintaining glucose homeostasis include suppressing glucagon release in response to caloric intake, delaying the rate of gastric emptying, and stimulating the satiety center in the brain to limit caloric intake. Pramlintide is indicated for adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes who have not achieved adequate glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy. As an adjunct to insulin therapy, pramlintide demonstrated significant reductions in A1C in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, with favorable effects on body weight. It is administered subcutaneously before each major meal. There is an increased risk of hypoglycemia with insulin when used in combination with pramlintide. Other adverse effects may include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, reduced appetite, and headache. Proper patient selection and education are essential to successful pramlintide use.", "meta": {"pmid": 26424675}}

The genetic cause of this developmental disorder is presently unknown. Here we describe 8 new patients with a phenotype of HSS. Individuals with HSS present with clinical features overlapping with some progeroid syndromes that belong to the laminopathies, such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD). HGPS is caused by de novo point mutations in the LMNA gene, coding for the nuclear lamina proteins lamin A and C. MAD with type A and B lipodystrophy are recessive disorders resulting from mutations in LMNA and ZMPSTE24, respectively. ZMPSTE24 in addition to ICMT encode proteins involved in posttranslational processing of lamin A. We hypothesized that HSS is an allelic disorder to HGPS and MAD. As the nuclear shape is often irregular in patients with LMNA mutations, we first analyzed the nuclear morphology in skin fibroblasts of patients with HSS, but could not identify any abnormality. Sequencing of the genes LMNA, ZMPSTE24 and ICMT in the 8 patients with HSS revealed the heterozygous missense mutation c.1930C>T (p.R644C) in LMNA in 1 female. Extreme phenotypic diversity and low penetrance have been associated with the p.R644C mutation. In ZMPSTE24 and ICMT, no pathogenic sequence change was detected in patients with HSS.

{"text": "IRAK4, a serine/threonine kinase is a central adaptor protein in TLR signaling. To better understand the clinical significance of IRAK4 deficiency we examined the impact of IRAK4 on bacterial recognition in human monocytes. We show that IRAK4 knockdown modulates monocyte-derived cytokine secretion in response to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, resulting in decreased IL-12 and elevated IL-10 production, a finding also reproducible with ligands for TLR2 and TLR4. In contrast, silencing of MyD88 leads to a complete loss of cytokine secretion, indicating that IRAK4 acts as a differential regulator of bacteria/TLR-induced cytokine secretion downstream of MyD88. Further analysis revealed that this modulatory function results from IRAK4-mediated suppression of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). Release of suppression upon IRAK4 silencing (but not MyD88 knockdown) increases phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, counteracts NF-\u03baB activation and finally results in a monocyte phenotype with tolerogenic features, thus unleashing Akt- and mTOR-dependent release of IL-10, along with concomitant phosphorylation of FOXO transcription factors. In line with these observations IRAK4-deficient monocytes failed to induce allogeneic CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell responses, an effect reverted by neutralization of IL-10. Taken together, our data highlight an unexpected role of IRAK4, Akt, and mTOR in the regulation of tolerance in human monocytes. ", "meta": {"pmid": 23519847}}
{"text": "Prion protein (PRNP) has been implicated in various types of neurodegenerative diseases. Although much is known about prion diseases, the function of cellular PRNP remains cryptic. Here, we show that PRNP mediates amyloid \u03b21\u201342 (A\u03b242)-induced autophagy activation through its interaction with BECN1. Treatment with A\u03b242 enhanced autophagy flux in neuronal cells. A\u03b242-induced autophagy activation, however, was impaired in prnp-knockout primary cortical neurons and Prnp-knockdown or prnp-knockout neuronal cells. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PRNP interacted with BECN1 via the BCL2-binding domain of BECN1. This interaction promoted the subcellular localization of BECN1 into lipid rafts of the plasma membrane and enhanced activity of PtdIns3K (whose catalytic subunit is termed PIK3C3, mammalian ortholog of yeast VPS34) in lipid rafts by generating PtdIns3P in response to A\u03b242. Further, the levels of lipid rafts that colocalized with BECN1, decreased in the brains of aged C57BL/6 mice, as did PRNP. These results suggested that PRNP interacts with BECN1 to recruit the PIK3C3 complex into lipid rafts and thus activates autophagy in response to A\u03b242, defining a novel role of PRNP in the regulation of autophagy.", "meta": {"pmid": 24145555}}

Here we use the pharmacological antagonist of CXCR4, AMD3100, to investigate the function of CXCL12/CXCR4 in regulating inflammatory response during acute ischemia. Adult male CD-1 mice (n=184) underwent permanent suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). AMD3100 was injected for 3 days (1 mg/kg/day) after MCAO. Brain water content, infarct volume, neurological score, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression and activity were examined at 24, 48, and 72 hours after MCAO. Proinflammatory cytokine RNA and protein levels in brain tissue were measured by RT-PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Neurological score was greatly improved in AMD3100-treated mice compared with the control mice 3 days after MCAO (P<0.05). Brain edema-induced change of water content, IgG protein leakage, Evans blue extravasation, occludin, and ZO-1 expression in ipsilateral hemisphere were alleviated by acute treatment of AMD3100. MPO expression and activity revealed that AMD3100 profoundly reduced the number of MPO-positive cells in the ischemic region (P<0.05). It also attenuated proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interferon \u03b3; their mRNA and protein levels changed accordingly compared with the controls (P<0.05).

{"text": "Prior treatment of NG108-15 cells with phosphatase inhibitors including okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibited the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by bradykinin by approximately 63%. This inhibition was dependent on the concentration of okadaic acid with an IC50 of 0.15 nM. Okadaic acid treatment only lowered the maximal response of [Ca2+]i increase and had no effect on the EC50 value for bradykinin regardless of the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Neither the capacity of 45Ca2+ accumulation within intracellular nonmitochondrial Ca2+ stores nor the magnitude of [Ca2+]i increase induced by thapsigargin was reduced by the treatment of okadaic acid. In contrast, the same phosphatase inhibitor treatment inhibited the bradykinin-evoked inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation, the Mn2+ influx, and the capacity of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. Furthermore, the sensitivity of IP3 in the Ca2+ release was suppressed by okadaic acid pretreatment. Our results suggest that the reduction of bradykinin-induced [Ca2+]i rise by the promotion of protein phosphorylation was attributed to the reduced activity of phospholipase C, the decreased sensitivity to IP3, and the slowed rate of Ca2+ influx. Thus, phosphorylation plays a role in bradykinin-sensitive Ca2+ signaling cascade in NG108-15 cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 9003077}}

Previous studies have indicated that mammalian Sept3 is a brain-specific protein that is abundant in synaptic terminals. Here, we further investigated the localization and function of Sept3 in the mouse brain. Sept3 is expressed in several types of post-mitotic neurons, including granule cells in the cerebellum and pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In primary cultures of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, Sept3 protein is enriched at the tips of growing neurites during differentiation. Sept3 directly binds to Sept5 and Sept7 and forms a heteromeric complex at nerve terminals adjacent to where a synaptic vesicle marker, synaptophysin, is expressed in mature neurons. When over-expressed in HEK293 cells, Sept3 forms filamentous structures that are dependent on the presence of its GTP- and phosphoinositide-binding domains.

Nanoparticles with pH-nonresponsive poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) cores made from PCL-block-PEG (PCL-PEG) were used for comparison. Nanoparticle sizes, zeta potentials, drug-loading capacities, and pH responsiveness were characterized. The cellular uptakes and localization in lysosomes were visualized by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Cytostatic effects of free and encapsulated cis-diammineplatinum(II) dichloride (cisplatin) toward human SKOV-3 epithelial ovarian cancer cells were estimated by using the MTT assay. Intraperitoneal tumor responses to cisplatin and cisplatin/PDEA-PEG were evaluated in athymic mice at 4-6 weeks postinoculation of SKOV-3 cells. PDEA-PEG nanoparticles dissolved at pH < 6 and rapidly internalized and transferred to lysosomes; it therefore was predicted that the PDEA nanoparticles would rapidly release cisplatin into cytoplasm upon integration into acidic lysosomes and thereby overwhelm the chemoresistant properties of SKOV-3 cells. Indeed, relative proportions of viable cells were diminished to a greater extent by exposure in vitro to fast-releasing nanoparticles compared to slow-releasing nanoparticles or an equivalent dose of free cisplatin.

In AERD pathophysiology, not only the reduced expression of E prostanoid 2 but also the dysfunction of its pathway could be involved. Moreover, eosinophils of AERD patients could be directly activated by aspirin to produce prostaglandin D2. Platelet activations are well known to be involved in AERD; however, plasma markers do not change during aspirin challenge tests. Additionally, novel genetic polymorphisms, such as P2RY12 and dipeptidyl peptidase 10 gene, and epigenetic predispositions of AERD were found. In AERD diagnosis, bronchial and nasal aspirin challenges have been applied in addition to oral challenge. Serum periostin has been suggested as a potential biomarker for AERD. Apart from standard pharmacological treatment and aspirin desensitization, biologics, including omalizumab and mepolizumab, as well as CRTH2 antagonists have been suggested as promising therapies for AERD treatment.

{"text": "Conformational dynamics are thought to be a prerequisite for the catalytic activity of enzymes. However, the exact relationship between structural fluctuations and function is not well understood. In this work hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) are used for exploring the conformational dynamics of thermolysin. Amide HDX reflects the internal mobility of proteins; regions that undergo frequent unfolding-refolding show faster exchange than segments that are highly stable. Thermolysin is a zinc protease with an active site that is located between two lobes. Substrate turnover is associated with hinge bending that leads to a closed conformation. Product release regenerates the open form, such that steady-state catalysis involves a continuous closing/opening cycle. HDX/ESI-MS with proteolytic peptide mapping in the absence of substrate shows that elements in the periphery of the two lobes are most mobile. A comparison with previous X-ray data suggests that these peripheral regions undergo quite pronounced structural changes during the catalytic cycle. In contrast, active site residues exhibit only a moderate degree of backbone flexibility, and the central zinc appears to be in a fairly rigid environment. The presence of both rigid and moderately flexible elements in the active site may reflect a carefully tuned balance that is required for function. Interestingly, the HDX behavior of catalytically active thermolysin is indistinguishable from that of the free enzyme. This result is consistent with the view that catalytically relevant motions preexist in the resting state and that enzyme function can only be performed within the limitations given by the intrinsic dynamics of the protein. The data presented in this work indicate the prevalence of stochastic elements in the function of thermolysin, rather than supporting a deterministic mechanism.", "meta": {"pmid": 18494500}}

TNF deficiency did not affect viral load or leukocyte recruitment but caused severe lung pathology and excessive production of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). Short-term blockade of these cytokines significantly reduced lung pathology in TNF-/- mice concomitant with induction of protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) and/or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), factors that inhibit STAT3 activation. Consequently, inhibition of STAT3 activation with an inhibitor reduced lung pathology. Long-term neutralization of IL-6 or TGF-\u03b2 protected TNF-/- mice from an otherwise lethal infection. Thus, mTNF alone is necessary and sufficient to regulate lung inflammation but it has no direct antiviral activity against ECTV. The data indicate that targeting specific cytokines or cytokine-signaling pathways to reduce or ameliorate lung inflammation during respiratory viral infections is possible but that the timing and duration of the interventive measure are critical.", "meta": {"pmid": 32571912}}
{"text": "Mutation of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) gene is responsible for Miller syndrome, which is characterized by craniofacial malformations with limb abnormalities. We previously demonstrated that DHODH was involved in forming a mitochondrial supercomplex and that mutated DHODH led to protein instability, loss of enzyme activity, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species in HeLa cells. To explore the etiology of Miller syndrome in more detail, we investigated the effects of DHODH inhibition in the cells involved in skeletal structure. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in MC3T3-E1 cells derived from mouse calvaria osteoblast precursor cells was knocked down by specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and cell proliferation, ATP production, and expression of bone-related genes were investigated in these cells. After depletion of DHODH using specific siRNAs, inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest occurred in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, ATP production was reduced in whole cells, especially in mitochondria. Furthermore, the levels of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (Ocn) mRNAs were lower in DHODH siRNA-treated cells compared with controls. These data suggest that depletion of DHODH affects the differentiation and maturation of osteoblasts. This study shows that mitochondrial dysfunction by DHODH depletion in osteoblasts can be directly linked to the abnormal bone formation in Miller syndrome.", "meta": {"pmid": 27086500}}
{"text": "NEUROG3 plays a central role in the development of both pancreatic islets and enteroendocrine cells. Homozygous hypomorphic missense mutations in NEUROG3 have been recently associated with a rare form of congenital malabsorptive diarrhea secondary to enteroendocrine cell dysgenesis. Interestingly, the patients did not develop neonatal diabetes but childhood-onset diabetes. We hypothesized that null mutations in NEUROG3 might be responsible for the disease in a patient with permanent neonatal diabetes and severe congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. The single coding exon of NEUROG3 was amplified and sequenced from genomic DNA. The mutant protein isoforms were functionally characterized by measuring their ability to bind to an E-box element in the NEUROD1 promoter in vitro and to induce ectopic endocrine cell formation and cell delamination after in ovo chicken endoderm electroporation. Two different heterozygous point mutations in NEUROG3 were identified in the proband [c.82G>T (p.E28X) and c.404T>C (p.L135P)], each being inherited from an unaffected parent. Both in vitro and in vivo functional studies indicated that the mutant isoforms are biologically inactive. In keeping with this, no enteroendocrine cells were detected in intestinal biopsy samples from the patient. Severe deficiency of neurogenin 3 causes a rare novel subtype of permanent neonatal diabetes.

{"text": "Renal cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 activity produces five primary prostanoids: prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2alpha, prostaglandin I2, thromboxane A2, and prostaglandin D2. These lipid mediators interact with a family of distinct G protein-coupled prostanoid receptors designated EP, FP, IP, TP, and DP, respectively, which exert important regulatory effects on renal function. The intrarenal distribution of these prostanoid receptors has been mapped, and the consequences of their activation have been partially characterized. FP, TP, and EP1 receptors preferentially couple to an increase in cell calcium. EP2, EP4, DP, and IP receptors stimulate cyclic AMP, whereas the EP3 receptor preferentially couples to Gi, inhibiting cyclic AMP generation. EP1 and EP3 mRNA expression predominates in the collecting duct and thick limb, respectively, where their stimulation reduces NaCl and water absorption, promoting natriuresis and diuresis. The FP receptor is highly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule, where it may have a distinct effect on renal salt transport. Although only low levels of EP2 receptor mRNA are detected in the kidney and its precise intrarenal localization is uncertain, mice with targeted disruption of the EP2 receptor exhibit salt-sensitive hypertension, suggesting that this receptor may also play an important role in salt excretion. In contrast, EP4 receptor mRNA is predominantly expressed in the glomerulus, where it may contribute to the regulation of glomerular hemodynamics and renin release. The IP receptor mRNA is highly expressed near the glomerulus, in the afferent arteriole, where it may also dilate renal arterioles and stimulate renin release. Conversely, TP receptors in the glomerulus may counteract the effects of these dilator prostanoids and increase glomerular resistance. At present there is little evidence for DP receptor expression in the kidney. These receptors act in a concerted fashion as physiological buffers, protecting the kidney from excessive functional changes during periods of physiological stress. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-mediated cyclooxygenase inhibition results in the loss of these combined effects, which contributes to their renal effects. Selective prostanoid receptor antagonists may provide new therapeutic approaches for specific disease states.", "meta": {"pmid": 11181968}}
{"text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently develops from hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We previously reported that peretinoin, an acyclic retinoid, inhibits HCV replication. This study aimed to examine the influence of peretinoin on the HBV lifecycle. HBV-DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) were evaluated by a qPCR method in HepG2.2.15 cells. Peretinoin significantly reduced the levels of intracellular HBV-DNA, nuclear cccDNA, and HBV transcript at a concentration that did not induce cytotoxicity. Conversely, other retinoids, such as 9-cis, 13-cis retinoic acid (RA), and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), had no effect or rather increased HBV replication. Mechanistically, although peretinoin increased the expression of HBV-related transcription factors, as observed for other retinoids, peretinoin enhanced the binding of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to cccDNA in the nucleus and negatively regulated HBV transcription. Moreover, peretinoin significantly inhibited the expression of SPHK1, a potential inhibitor of HDAC activity, and might be involved in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC. SPHK1 overexpression in cells cancelled the inhibition of HBV replication induced by peretinoin. This indicates that peretinoin activates HDAC1 and thereby suppresses HBV replication by inhibiting the sphingosine metabolic pathway. Therefore, peretinoin may be a novel therapeutic agent for HBV replication and chemoprevention against HCC.", "meta": {"pmid": 29360739}}

Six discovery cohorts including 13,312 samples were analyzed, followed by in-silico and de-novo replication studies including an additional 2,800 individuals. A total of 10 genome-wide significant variants were identified at 7 loci. Four were novel loci (5q14.3, 10q21.3, 16q24.2 and 18q22.3) and the leading variants at these loci were rs114694170 (MEF2C, P = 6.79 x 10(-13)), rs74506613 (JMJD1C, P = 1.17 x 10(-19)), rs4782371 (ZFPM1, P = 1.59 x 10(-9)) and rs2639990 (ZADH2, P = 1.72 x 10(-8)), respectively.

To obtain insights into the logic used by SOX9 to control a network of target genes in chondrocytes, we performed a ChIP-on-chip experiment using SOX9 antibodies. The ChIP DNA was hybridized to a microarray, which covered 80 genes, many of which are involved in chondrocyte differentiation. Hybridization peaks were detected in a series of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) genes including Col2a1, Col11a2, Aggrecan and Cdrap as well as in genes for specific transcription factors and signaling molecules. Our results also showed SOX9 interaction sites in genes that code for proteins that enhance the transcriptional activity of SOX9. Interestingly, a strong SOX9 signal was also observed in genes such as Col1a1 and Osx, whose expression is strongly down regulated in chondrocytes but is high in osteoblasts. In the Col2a1 gene, in addition to an interaction site on a previously identified enhancer in intron 1, another strong interaction site was seen in intron 6.

To assess the frequency and clinical outcome of potentially harmful drug metabolic interactions in hospitalized patients, the authors performed a survey of the medication data of patients treated on internal and pulmonary medicine wards in a university hospital. The database was searched for concomitantly administered drug pairs that would, according to Hansten and Horn's drug interaction database, carry a high risk for a clinically harmful metabolic drug interaction. Coadministrations involving warfarin or cisapride were subjected to further analysis regarding clinical outcome. A total of 142 patients were exposed to 150 interactions with potentially harmful clinical outcome, resulting in a frequency of 0.9% (95% CI 0.7% to 1.0%). Inhibition of warfarin metabolism by metronidazole produced significant overanticoagulation as evidenced by elevated international normalized ratio values, whereas inducers (rifampicin and phenobarbital) of warfarin metabolism significantly reduced the efficacy of warfarin. One case of minor bleeding and one case of clavicular vein thrombosis were detected as possible consequences of disturbed anticoagulation.

{"text": "Clinical studies suggest that the oral acyclic retinoid Peretinoin may reduce the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following surgical ablation of primary tumours. Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of HCC, we assessed whether Peretinoin and other retinoids have any effect on HCV infection. For this purpose, we measured the effects of several retinoids on the replication of genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a HCV in vitro. Peretinoin inhibited RNA replication for all genotypes and showed the strongest antiviral effect among the retinoids tested. Furthermore, it reduced infectious virus release by 80-90% without affecting virus assembly. These effects could be due to reduced signalling from lipid droplets, triglyceride abundance, and the expression of mature sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and fatty acid synthase.

This technique was used to look at conditioning to a light CS, and to the odors of beeswax, geraniol, citral, and hexanal. The results indicate that acquisition was best when sucrose was paired with the odor of beeswax. Conditioning to the remaining odors was roughly similar, but acquisition did not occur using a light. In a second series of experiments, odors were no longer followed by sucrose feedings and the conditioned response slowly disappeared. With the exception of geraniol as a CS, this extinction effect did not occur if the animals continued to be fed on an unpaired schedule. In a third series of experiments, conditioned inhibition was demonstrated when geraniol was used as conditioned stimuli, but no effect was found when the odors of hexanal, citral and wax were used.

{"text": "1. Ischaemia was simulated in the isolated sheep cardiac Purkinje fibre and guinea-pig papillary muscle by immersing the preparations in paraffin oil. Ion-selective microelectrodes recorded potassium (Ks+) and pH (pHs) in the thin film of Tyrode solution trapped at the fibre surface while other microelectrodes recorded intracellular pH (pHi), membrane potential and action potentials (AP) (evoked by field stimulation), or membrane current (two-microelectrode voltage clamp in shortened Purkinje fibres). Twitch tension was also monitored. The paraffin oil model reproduced the salient characteristics of myocardial ischaemia, i.e. a decrease of twitch tension; a decrease of pHi and pHs; a rise in Ks+ (by 2-3 mM); a depolarization of diastolic membrane potential; considerable shortening of the AP (up to 30% within 4 min). 2. The sulphonylurea compounds, glibenclamide (200 microM) and tolbutamide (1 mM), known inhibitors of the KATP channel, completely blocked the ischaemic rise of Ks+ and prevented AP shortening. Ischaemic tension decline was notably less pronounced in the presence of sulphonylureas. 3. The ischaemic increase of slope conductance (Purkinje fibre) was prevented by 1 mM-tolbutamide and 200 microM-glibenclamide. 4. Sulphonylureas did not affect resting membrane potential, the AP or the current-voltage relationship under non-ischaemic conditions (this also indicates that ischaemic Ks+ accumulation is not fuelled by the background K+ current [iK1] which was shown, as expected, to be Ba2+ sensitive). 5. In a normally perfused preparation, reducing intracellular ATP by inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (DOG) produced a similar AP shortening plus a membrane hyperpolarization, both of which were inhibited by tolbutamide or glibenclamide. The AP shortening was not related uniquely to the fall of pHi observed under these conditions since experimentally reducing pHi (by reducing pHo in the absence of DOG) lengthened rather than shortened the AP. 6. The possibility that the ischaemic rise in Ks+ might be the cause of AP shortening was excluded by the observation that, in a normally perfused Purkinje fibre, experimentally reducing pHi (by an amount similar to that seen during ischaemia) completely neutralized the AP-shortening effect of an elevated Ko+ (from 4.5 to 6.5 mM). Furthermore, the sulphonylurea-sensitive AP shortening seen during DOG treatment could not have been associated with a Ks+ rise since, in these particular experiments, the fibres were well perfused and diastolic membrane potential hyperpolarized.", "meta": {"pmid": 2129231}}

{"text": "Human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the most abundant hepatic and intestinal phase I enzyme that metabolizes approximately 50% marketed drugs. The crystal structure of bound and unbound CYP3A4 has been recently constructed, and a small active site and a peripheral binding site are identified. A recent study indicates that CYP3A4 undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon binding to ketoconazole or erythromycin with a differential but substantial (>80%) increase in the active site volume, providing a structural basis for ligand promiscuity of CYP3A4. A number of important drugs have been identified as substrates, inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4. The ability of drugs to act as inducers, inhibitors, or substrates for CYP3A is predictive of whether concurrent administration of these compounds with a known CYP3A substrate might lead to altered drug disposition, efficacy or toxicity. The substrates of CYP3A4 considerably overlap with those of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To date, the identified clinically important CYP3A4 inhibitors mainly include macrolide antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, and erythromycin), anti-HIV agents (e.g., ritonavir and delavirdine), antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine and fluvoxamine), calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil and diltiazem), steroids and their modulators (e.g., gestodene and mifepristone), and several herbal and dietary components. Many of these drugs are also mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP3A4, which involves formation of reactive metabolites, binding to CYP3A4 and irreversible enzyme inactivation. A small number of drugs such as rifampin, phenytoin and ritonavir are identified as inducers of CYP3A4. The orphan nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), have been found to play a critical role in the induction of CYP3A4. The inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 by drugs often causes unfavorable and long-lasting drug-drug interactions and probably fatal toxicity, depending on many factors associated with the enzyme, drugs and the patients. The study of interactions of newly synthesized compounds with CYP3A4 has been incorporated into drug development and detection of possible CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers during the early stages of drug development is critical in preventing potential drug-drug interactions and side effects.

{"text": "An increase in oxidative stress is an important pathological mechanism of heart injury induced by doxorubicin (DOX). Tranilast is an anti-allergy drug that has been shown to possess good antioxidant activity in previous studies. The overexpression and secretion of chymase by mast cells (MCs) increase the pathological overexpression of angiotensin II (Ang II), which plays a crucial role in myocardial hypertrophy and the deterioration of heart disease. The MC stabilizer tranilast (N-(3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid; tran) prevents mast cells from degranulating, which may reduce DOX-induced Ang II synthesis. Therefore, in the present study, we hypothesized that tranilast will protect rats from DOX-induced myocardial damage via its antioxidant activity, thereby inhibiting Ang II expression. Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups (n = 10 in each group) that received DOX, a combination of DOX and tranilast or saline (the control group) to test this hypothesis. Tranilast suppressed chymase expression, reduced Ang II levels and prevented the myocardial hypertrophy and the deterioration of heart function induced by DOX.

The steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3), also known as p/CIP, RAC3, AIB1, ACTR and TRAM-1, is a cancer-amplified coactivator in the SRC gene family that also contains SRC-1 and TIF2/GRIP1. SRC-3 interacts with nuclear receptors and certain other transcription factors, recruits histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases for chromatin remodeling and facilitates target gene transcription. Accumulated results from both ex vivo and animal model studies indicate that SRC-3 plays important roles in many biological processes involving cell proliferation, cell migration, cell differentiation, somatic growth, sexual maturation, female reproductive function, vasoprotection and breast cancer. This article summarizes our current knowledge about SRC-3 under the following topics: molecular cloning and characterization; molecular structure and functional mechanisms; SRC-3 as a molecular target of growth factors and cytokines; organization and expression of the SRC-3 gene; generation and characterization of SRC-3 knockout mice; role of SRC-3 in the vasoprotective effects of estrogen; role of SRC-3 in cell migration, proliferation and cancers.", "meta": {"pmid": 12650696}}

End-point measures evaluated after adjustment for multiplicity included 20% improvement according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20 response) (the primary end point), the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28), the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, and the Simplified Disease Activity Index at week 12, as well as radiographic progression of joint damage as measured by the van der Heijde modification of the total Sharp score (mTSS) (range, 0 to 448, with higher scores indicating greater structural joint damage) at week 24. More patients had an ACR20 response at week 12 with baricitinib than with placebo (primary end point, 70% vs. 40%, P<0.001). All major secondary objectives were met, including inhibition of radiographic progression of joint damage, according to the mTSS at week 24 with baricitinib versus placebo (mean change from baseline, 0.41 vs. 0.90; P<0.001) and an increased ACR20 response rate at week 12 with baricitinib versus adalimumab (70% vs. 61%, P=0.014).

{"text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with higher risk of tendinopathy, which reduces tolerance to exercise and functional activities and affects lifestyle and glycemic control. Expression of tendon-related genes and matrix metabolism in tenocytes are essential for maintaining physiological functions of tendon. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in diabetic tendinopathy remain unclear. We hypothesized that high glucose (HG) alters the characteristics of tenocyte. Using in vitro 2-week culture of tenocytes, we found that expression of tendon-related genes, including Egr1, Mkx, TGF-\u03b21, Col1a2, and Bgn, was significantly decreased in HG culture and that higher glucose consumption occurred. Down-regulation of Egr1 by siRNA decreased Scx, Mkx, TGF-\u03b21, Col1a1, Col1a2, and Bgn expression. Blocking AMPK activation with Compound C reduced the expression of Egr1, Scx, TGF-\u03b21, Col1a1, Col1a2, and Bgn in the low glucose condition. In addition, histological examination of tendons from diabetic mice displayed larger interfibrillar space and uneven glycoprotein deposition. Thus, we concluded that high glucose alters tendon homeostasis through downregulation of the AMPK/Egr1 pathway and the expression of downstream tendon-related genes in tenocytes. The findings render a molecular basis of the mechanism of diabetic tendinopathy and may help develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for the pathology.", "meta": {"pmid": 28266660}}

{"text": "SETD2, an epigenetic tumor suppressor, is frequently mutated in MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemia and relapsed acute leukemia (AL). To clarify the impact of SETD2 mutations on chemotherapy sensitivity in MLLr leukemia, two loss-of-function (LOF) Setd2-mutant alleles (Setd2F2478L/WT or Setd2Ex6-KO/WT) were generated and introduced, respectively, to the Mll-Af9 knock-in leukemia mouse model. Both alleles cooperated with Mll-Af9 to accelerate leukemia development that resulted in resistance to standard Cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells showed downregulated signaling related to cell cycle progression, S, and G2/M checkpoint regulation. Thus, after Cytarabine treatment, Setd2-mutant leukemic cells exit from the S phase and progress to the G2/M phase. Importantly, S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint inhibition could resensitize the Mll-Af9/Setd2 double-mutant cells to standard chemotherapy by causing DNA replication collapse, mitotic catastrophe, and increased cell death. These findings demonstrate that LOF SETD2 mutations confer chemoresistance on AL to DNA-damaging treatment by S and G2/M checkpoint defects. The combination of S and G2/M checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy can be explored as a promising therapeutic strategy by exploiting their unique vulnerability and resensitizing chemoresistant AL with SETD2 or SETD2-like epigenetic mutations.", "meta": {"pmid": 30967619}}

In this paper, we report a man who developed a work-related dermatitis when working on the painting of metal frames. He was exposed to polyester powder pigments containing TGIC. When patch tested, he was negative to TGIC (prepared in 1988) 3x and positive to polyester powder pigment.

Chemical analyses showed that there was no TGIC in the test preparation from 1988, and that in the TGIC powder from 1988, there was only 30% of the expected amount of TGIC. The investigations, clinical and chemical, strongly indicate degradation of TGIC in the test preparation and powder. Both substances and the test preparations made from them may change over time.

MLPA identified a single probe deletion in the SNAP29 gene within band 22q11.21. Follow-up array CGH testing revealed a ~1.4-Mb deletion from 19,405,375 bp to 20,797,502 bp, encompassing 28 genes. This deletion is likely to be causally associated with the proband's congenital anomalies.

{"text": "Ischemic-induced white matter injury is strongly correlated with the poor neurological outcomes in stroke patients. The transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is an effective candidate for enhancing re-myelination in congenitally dysmyelinated brain and spinal cord. Nevertheless, mechanisms governing the recovery of white matter and axon after OPCs transplantation are incompletely understood in ischemic stroke. In this study, OPCs were transplanted into the ischemic brain at 7 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We observed improved behavior recovery and reduced brain atrophy volume at 28 days after OPCs transplantation. Moreover, our results identified that myelin sheath integrity and endogenous OPCs proliferation and migration were promoted after OPCs transplantation. By contrast, AMD3100, an antagonist of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4, eliminated the beneficial effects of OPCs transplantation on white matter integrity and endogenous oligodendrogenesis. In addition, the improvement of neurite growth and synaptogenesis after OPCs transplantation in ischemic brain or OPC co-cultured neurons, potentially through the upregulation of Netrin-1, was indicated by increased protein levels of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95. Knockdown of Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma, a receptor of Netrin-1, prevented increased neurite growth and synaptogenesis in neurons co-cultured with OPCs.

{"text": "Src family kinases (SFK) are critical for initiating and regulating the response of mast cells activated by engagement of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI. Lyn is the predominant SFK in mast cells and has been ascribed both positive and negative roles in regulating mast cell activation. We analyzed the mast cell phenotype of WeeB, a recently described mouse mutant that expresses a Lyn protein with profoundly reduced catalytic activity. Surprisingly, we found that this residual activity is sufficient for wild-type levels of cytokine production and degranulation in bone marrow-derived mast cells after low-intensity stimulation with anti-IgE. High-intensity stimulation of lyn(-/-) bone marrow-derived mast cells with highly multivalent Ag resulted in enhanced cytokine production as previously reported, and WeeB cells displayed an intermediate phenotype. Under this latter condition, SFK inhibition using PP2 increased cytokine production in wild-type and WeeB but not lyn(-/-) cells, resulting in substantially higher levels in the PP2-treated WeeB than in lyn(-/-) cells. Restoration of wild-type and WeeB lyn alleles in lyn(-/-) cells generated activation phenotypes similar to those in nontransduced wild-type and WeeB cells, respectively, whereas a kinase-dead allele resulted in a phenotype similar to that of empty-vector-transduced cells. These data indicate that inhibition of Lyn and/or SFK activity can result in higher levels of mast cell activation than simple deletion of lyn and that only near-complete inhibition of Lyn can impair its positive regulatory functions. Furthermore, the data suggest that both positive and negative regulatory functions of Lyn are predominantly carried out by its catalytic activity and not an adaptor function.", "meta": {"pmid": 19949072}}

Because the balance of T cell subpopulations is critical for the balance of the mucosal immune system, this study explores the regulatory potency of HDAC inhibitors on T cell polarization as a mechanistic explanation for the observed anti-inflammatory effects. Although HDAC inhibition suppressed the polarization toward the pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells, it enhanced forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)(+) regulatory T cell polarization in vitro and in vivo at the site of inflammation in the lamina propria. This was paralleled by a down-regulation of the interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) on na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells on the mRNA as well as on the protein level and changes in the chromatin acetylation at the IL6R gene and its promoter. Downstream of the IL-6R, HDAC inhibition was followed by a decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation as well as retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b3T (ROR\u03b3T) expression, thus identifying the IL-6/STAT3/IL-17 pathway as an important target of HDAC inhibitors. These results directly translated to experimental colitis, where IL-6R expression was suppressed in na\u00efve T cells, paralleled by a significant reduction of Th17 cells in the lamina propria of ITF2357-treated animals, resulting in the amelioration of disease.

Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were subsequently performed to study the function and pathway enrichment of the identified DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape was used to calculate the degree of connectivity of proteins in the PPI network, and the two genes with the highest degree of connectivity were selected for further analysis. Additionally, the two DEGs with the largest and smallest log Fold Change values were selected. These six key genes were further examined using Oncomine and the Kaplan-Meier plotter platform. A total of 99 upregulated and 172 downregulated genes common to all four GEO datasets were screened. The DEGs were primarily enriched in the Biological Process terms: 'extracellular matrix organization', 'collagen catabolic process' and 'cell adhesion'. These three KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in the categories: 'ECM-receptor interaction', 'protein digestion and absorption', and 'focal adhesion'. Based on Oncomine, expression of ATP4A and ATP4B were downregulated in GC, whereas expression of the other genes were all upregulated. The Kaplan-Meier plotter platform confirmed that upregulated expression of the identified key genes was significantly associated with worse overall survival of patients with GC.

A deficiency of PLP can present, therefore, as seizures and other symptoms that are treatable with PLP and/or pyridoxine. Deficiency of PLP in the brain can be caused by inborn errors affecting B6 vitamer metabolism or by inactivation of PLP, which can occur when compounds accumulate as a result of inborn errors of other pathways or when small molecules are ingested. Whole-exome sequencing of two children from a consanguineous family with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in proline synthetase co-transcribed homolog (bacterial), PROSC, which encodes a PLP-binding protein of hitherto unknown function. Subsequent sequencing of 29 unrelated indivduals with pyridoxine-responsive epilepsy identified four additional children with biallelic PROSC mutations. Pre-treatment cerebrospinal fluid samples showed low PLP concentrations and evidence of reduced activity of PLP-dependent enzymes. However, cultured fibroblasts showed excessive PLP accumulation. An E.coli mutant lacking the PROSC homolog (\u0394YggS) is pyridoxine sensitive; complementation with human PROSC restored growth whereas hPROSC encoding p.Leu175Pro, p.Arg241Gln, and p.Ser78Ter did not. PLP, a highly reactive aldehyde, poses a problem for cells, which is how to supply enough PLP for apoenzymes while maintaining free PLP concentrations low enough to avoid unwanted reactions with other important cellular nucleophiles.

Our aim is to further explore the deeper association between some genetic variations related to ERCC1 polymorphisms and CBP risk. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of XRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing 1), CD3EAP (CD3e molecule, epsilon associated protein), PPP1R13L (protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 13 like), XPB (Xeroderma pigmentosum group B), XPC (Xeroderma pigmentosum group C) and XPF (Xeroderma pigmentosum group F) were genotyped by the Snapshot and TaqMan-MGB\u00ae probe techniques, in a study involving 102 CBP patients and 204 controls. The potential interactions between these SNPs and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and drinking, were assessed using a stratified analysis. An XRCC1 allele, rs25487, was related to a higher risk of CBP (P<0.001) even after stratifying for potential confounders. Carriers of the TT genotype of XRCC1 rs1799782 who were alcohol drinkers (OR = 8.000; 95% CI: 1.316-48.645; P = 0.022), male (OR = 9.333; 95% CI: 1.593-54.672; P = 0.019), and had an exposure of \u226412 years (OR = 2.612; 95% CI: 1.048-6.510; P = 0.035) had an increased risk of CBP. However, the T allele in PPP1R13L rs1005165 (P<0.05) and the GA allele in CD3EAP rs967591 (OR = 0.162; 95% CI: 0039~0.666; P = 0.037) decreased the risk of CBP in men. The haplotype analysis of XRCC1 indicated that XRCC1 rs25487A, rs25489G and rs1799782T (OR = 15.469; 95% CI: 5.536-43.225; P<0.001) were associated with a high risk of CBP. The findings showed that the rs25487 and rs1799782 polymorphisms of XRCC1 may contribute to an individual's susceptibility to CBP and may be used as valid biomarkers. Overall, the genes on chromosome 19q13.2-3 may have a special significance in the development of CBP in occupationally exposed Chinese populations.", "meta": {"pmid": 26681190}}

Experimental diets were 1) either protected palm oil (control) or 2) extruded linseed (linseed). Cows (n\u202f=\u202f16) were fed from calving date to 70 days in milk (DIM). There was no difference between groups (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fS.E.M.) in parity (3.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.00) or body condition score (BCS) at calving day (3.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25). At 30 DIM, the ovulatory cycles of cows were synchronized using two injections of prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) with a 14-day interval. On day 15 of synchronized estrous cycle (d0\u202f=\u202fovulation) uterine endometrial biopsies were collected to evaluate the expression of genes related to ECS (endocannabinoid receptor (CNR2), N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPEPLD), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA), monoglyceride lipase (MGLL)) and PGF2\u03b1. Results showed that dry matter intake and milk yield were not affected by diets. Uterine endometrial NAAA (7.69 fold), and MGLL (1.96 fold) genes expression were greater (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) in cows fed linseed compared with control ones. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of CNR-2 (4.26 fold), and NAPEPLD (20.0 fold) were decreased (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) in animals fed linseed compared to control cows. The expression of mRNA for the FAAH was not influenced by the diets. First service conception rate was greater in cows fed linseed compared to control cows (75 vs. 25%). Pregnancy loss within 32-60 day after artificial insemination (AI) was lower in cows fed linseed compared to control cows (0 vs. 100%). In conclusion these data demonstrated that positive effect of omega-3 on reproduction may act through a mechanism involving the ECS. However, more studies to be undertaken to confirm these results.", "meta": {"pmid": 30145543}}
{"text": "Activated STAT3 signaling is critical for human medulloblastoma cells. SHP2, SOCS3 and PIAS3 are known as the negative regulators of STAT3 signaling, while their relevance to frequent STAT3 activation in medulloblastomas remains unknown. Tissue microarrays were constructed with 17 tumor-surrounding noncancerous brain tissues and 61 cases of the classic medulloblastomas, 44 the large-cell medulloblastomas, and 15 nodular medulloblastomas, which were used for immunohistochemical profiling of STAT3, SHP2, SOCS3 and PIAS3 expression patterns and the frequencies of STAT3 nuclear translocation. Three human medulloblastoma cell lines (Daoy, UW228-2 and UW228-3) were cultured with and without 100 \u03bcM resveratrol supplementation. The influences of resveratrol in SHP2, SOCS3 and PIAS3 expression and SOCS3 knockdown in STAT3 activation were analyzed using multiple experimental approaches. SHP2, SOCS3 and PIAS3 levels are reduced in medulloblastomas in vivo and in vitro, of which PIAS3 downregulation is more reversely correlated with STAT3 activation. In resveratrol-suppressed medulloblastoma cells with STAT3 downregulation and decreased incidence of STAT3 nuclear translocation, PIAS3 is upregulated, the SHP2 level remains unchanged and SOCS3 is downregulated. SOCS3 proteins are accumulated in the distal ends of axon-like processes of resveratrol-differentiated medulloblastoma cells. Knockdown of SOCS3 expression by siRNA neither influences cell proliferation nor STAT3 activation or resveratrol sensitivity but inhibits resveratrol-induced axon-like process formation. Our results suggest that (1) the overall reduction of SHP2, SOCS3 and PIAS3 in medulloblastoma tissues and cell lines; (2) the more inverse relevance of PIAS3 expression with STAT3 activation; (3) the favorable prognostic values of PIAS3 for medulloblastomas and (4) the involvement of SOCS3 in resveratrol-promoted axon regeneration of medulloblastoma cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 28035977}}

However, the regulatory effect of PPAR\u03b3 on milk fat synthesis in buffalo mammary gland is not clear. In order to explore the role of buffalo PPARG gene in milk fat synthesis, lentivirus-mediated interference was used to knock it down and then the recombinant fusion expression vector was transfected into buffalo mammary epithelial cell (BMEC) to overexpress it. PPARG gene knockdown significantly decreased the expression of CD36, FABP3, FABP4, ACSS2, ELOVL6, DGAT2, BTN1A1, AGPAT6, LPIN1, ABCG2, PPARGC1A, INSIG1, FASN, and SREBF2 genes and significantly upregulated the expression of INSIG2 gene but had no significant effect on the expression of ACSL1, GPAM, and SREBF1 genes. PPARG overexpression significantly increased the relative mRNA abundance of CD36, FABP3, FABP4, ACSS2, ELOVL6, DGAT2, BTN1A1, AGPAT6, LPIN1, PPARGC1A, INSIG1, and SREBF2 genes and significantly downregulated the expression of INSIG2 gene but had no significant effect on the expression of ACSL1, GPAM, ABCG2, FASN, and SREBF1 genes.

In adult mice, both PrP and Shadoo have shown overlapping expression patterns and shared functions. Their expression in the mouse embryo has also been suggested to be complementary, as invalidation of both genes results in embryonic lethality. The developmental expression profile of PrP has been described from post-implantation stages up until birth. However the spatial expression pattern of Shadoo in the developing mouse embryo is not known. We previously described the expression profile of the prion-like protein Shadoo in adult mice using Sprn reporter mice (Sprn-GFP and Sprn-LacZ).

{"text": "This review summarizes the results of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies in man with pantoprazole, a new, selective proton pump inhibitor. Various mechanisms have to be considered as causes for potential drug-drug interactions. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in general may alter the absorption of drugs by increasing the intragastric pH. Due to the presence of an imidazole ring, the PPIs of the class of substituted benzimidazole sulfoxides may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs by altering the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, via either induction or inhibition. With the increasing use of PPIs, their interaction potential gains therapeutic importance as was the case with the first and second generation of H2-blockers (cimetidine and ranitidine, respectively). The enhanced selectivity of pantoprazole to the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase characterizes the new PPI generation. In contrast to omeprazole, pantoprazole has a low potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 system in man. In the drug interaction studies conducted so far, substrates for all relevant cytochrome P450 families involved in the metabolism of drugs in man were investigated. Pantoprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, digoxin, ethanol, glibenclamide, a hormonal contraceptive (combination of levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin in man. Pantoprazole also neither induced the metabolism of antipyrine or caffeine, nor increased urinary excretion of the induction markers D-glucaric acid and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol. Vice versa, the investigated drugs had no relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole.", "meta": {"pmid": 8793602}}
{"text": "Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women worldwide. Approximately 40% of patients with breast cancer acquire endocrine resistance following therapy with tamoxifen. Many explanations for the development of endocrine resistance have been put forward, one of them being the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lncRNA HOTAIRM1, known to be involved in myelopoiesis as well as transcriptional regulation of the HOXA genes in embryonic stem cells, is also expressed in breast cancer cells. This study explored the molecular mechanisms of HOTAIRM1 involved in acquired tamoxifen resistance. We showed that HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 are concurrently up-regulated in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 (TAMR) cells. Knockdown of HOTAIRM1 down-regulated HOXA1 expression and restored sensitivity to tamoxifen. In addition, the knockdown of HOXA1 showed similar effects, suggesting that the HOTAIRM1/HOXA1 axis regulates tamoxifen resistance. Furthermore, we showed that HOTAIRM1 directly interacts with EZH2 and prevents the PRC2 complex from binding and depositing H3K27me3 on the putative promoter of HOXA1. Together, our findings suggest that HOXA1 and its neighboring lncRNA, HOTAIRM1, might serve as potential therapeutic targets for ER+ breast cancer patients who have acquired tamoxifen resistance.", "meta": {"pmid": 32284737}}
{"text": "The HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) saquinavir is available as a soft gelatin capsule (SGC) formulation. At the recommended dosage of saquinavir SGC (1200mg 3 times daily), this formulation provides around 8-fold greater exposure than the established hard gelatin capsule (HGC) formulation at the recommended dosage of 600mg 3 times daily. As with the HGC formulation, the most common adverse events seen with saquinavir SGC are gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort and nausea). Some of these may occur with a slightly higher frequency with the SGC than with the HGC formulation. Saquinavir SGC has only a minimal effect on nonfasting serum lipid and cholesterol levels. Like other PIs, saquinavir is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme and is susceptible to interactions with inducers (e.g. rifabutin and rifampicin) and inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin and ketoconazole) of this enzyme. Ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir and delavirdine, all CYP3A4 inhibitors, greatly increase saquinavir plasma concentrations and the therapeutic implications of these interactions continue to be evaluated. While saquinavir is the least potent CYP 3A inhibitor among the PIs, several drugs (notably terfenadine, astemizole and cisapride) should not be given in combination with saquinavir. Therefore, although the SGC formulation enhances saquinavir exposure, it has a similar safety profile to the HGC formulation.", "meta": {"pmid": 11347724}}

The mechanism by which mutant LRSAM1 contributes to the development of neuropathy is currently unclear. The aim of this study was to induce LRSAM1 deficiency in a neuronal cell model, observe its effect on cell growth and morphology and attempt to rescue the phenotype with ancestral and mutant LRSAM1 transfections. In this experimental study, we investigated the effect of LRSAM1 downregulation on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA technology where cells were transfected with siRNA against LRSAM1. The effects on the expression levels of TSG101, the only currently known LRSAM1 interacting molecule, were also examined. An equal dosage of ancestral or mutant LRSAM1 construct was transfected in LRSAM1-downregulated cells to investigate its effect on the phenotype of the cells and whether cell proliferation and morphology could be rescued. A significant reduction in TSG101 levels was observed with the downregulation of LRSAM1. In addition, LRSAM1 knockdown significantly decreased the growth rate of SH-SY5Y cells which is caused by a decrease in cell proliferation. An effect on cell morphology was also observed. Furthermore, we overexpressed the ancestral and the c.2047-1G>A mutant LRSAM1 in knocked down cells. Ancestral LRSAM1 recovered cell proliferation and partly the morphology, however, the c.2047-1G>A mutant did not recover cell proliferation and further aggravated the observed changes in cell morphology. Our findings suggest that depletion of LRSAM1 affects neuroblastoma cells growth and morphology and that overexpression of the c.2047-1G>A mutant form, unlike the ancestral LRSAM1, fails to rescue the phenotype.", "meta": {"pmid": 29845787}}
{"text": "FGD1 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42. Mutations in the FGD1 gene are responsible for an X-linked disorder known as Aarskog-Scott syndrome (AAS). While most mutations were found in the catalytic region, which consists of Dbl homology (DH) domain and adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a missense mutation in the proline-rich domain is also found in a patient with typical clinical features as AAS. In this mutant FGD1, the serine residue at 205 is replaced with isoleucine. We recently demonstrated that FGD1 translocated to the membrane in response to extracellular stimuli such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) whereas FGD1 with S(205)/I substitution did not. Here we show that the proline-rich domain is critical for FGD1-induced directionally persistent cell migration. When inducibly expressed in HeLa Tet-Off cells, FGD1 stimulates directional migration whereas FGD1 with S(205)/I substitution does not affect it. We further demonstrate that FGD1 augments EGF-stimulated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. In the presence of JNK inhibitor SP600125, motility of FGD1-expressing cells is significantly impaired, indicating a critical role of JNK in cell migration. However, FGD3, an FGD1 homologue lacking the proline-rich domain, and FGD1 with S(205)/I substitution augment EGF-stimulated JNK activation similarly to FGD1, suggesting that the proline-rich domain is not involved in the regulation of JNK. Finally, we show that FGD1, but not FGD1 with S(205)/I substitution, is phosphorylated in response to EGF, suggesting that the phosphorylation of S(205) may trigger the FGD1 translocation to the leading edge membrane and enable cells to undergo directional migration.", "meta": {"pmid": 21212517}}
{"text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease that can be caused by a spectrum of genetic variants ranging from low to high penetrance changes, that interact with the environment to determine which individuals will develop the disease.

Eight genes, CHAD, CHD1L, ERCC6, IGTB7, PTPN13, SPATA20, TDG and TGS1, were selected and re-sequenced in a further 304 early onset CRC patients to search for rare, high-impact variants. Although we found a recurring truncating variant in the TDG gene shared by two independent patients, the results obtained did not help consolidate any of the candidates as promising CRC predisposing genes. However, we found that potential risk alleles in our extended list of candidate variants have a tendency to appear at higher numbers in younger cases. This supports the idea that CRC onset may be oligogenic in nature and may show molecular heterogeneity. Further, larger and robust studies are thus needed to unravel the genetics behind early-onset CRC development, coupled with novel functional analyses and omic approaches that may offer complementary insight.", "meta": {"pmid": 34045552}}

Two cDNAs (YY1 and YY2), representing genes that are specifically expressed in anthers at the uninucleate microspore stage, were isolated and characterized. YY1 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 95 amino acids. Eight cysteine residues with the potential to form disulfide bridges were present in the amino acid sequence. There was a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus of the putative protein, suggesting that the YY1 protein might be secreted. This cysteine motif and the hydrophobic N-terminus are conserved among products of several anther-specific genes or cDNAs isolated from various plant species. These proteins are thought to form a superfamily of proteins that are confined to anthers. The YY1 transcript was localized in the tapetal cells and the peripheral cells of the vascular bundle. YY2 cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 389 amino acids and the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited substantial homology to that of chalcone synthase.

Fluvastatin's distinct structure may be responsible for the biopharmaceutical properties that result in its low systemic exposure and, subsequently, low incidence of peripheral adverse events, such as headache and myositis. Fluvastatin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; has a 30-minute half-life, the shortest of any currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (lovastatin, 15 hours; pravastatin, 2 hours; simvastatin, 15.6 hours); is highly selective for the liver, undergoing extensive first-pass metabolism; has no active circulating metabolites; and does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, unlike lovastatin and simvastatin. The low systemic exposure suggests that the occurrence of peripheral adverse events, such as myositis, central nervous system effects, and drug-drug interactions, may be less than what is currently observed with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Neither niacin nor propranolol had an effect on fluvastatin plasma levels when combined with fluvastatin. In contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fluvastatin in combination with niacin resulted in no instances of myositis or other serious adverse events.

{"text": "Cachexia is a serious complication of many chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although patients with advanced CHF or CKD often have increased angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and cachexia and Ang II causes skeletal muscle wasting in rodents, the potential effects of Ang II on muscle regeneration are unknown. Muscle regeneration is highly dependent on the ability of a pool of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) to proliferate and to repair damaged myofibers or form new myofibers. Here we show that Ang II reduced skeletal muscle regeneration via inhibition of satellite cell (SC) proliferation. Ang II reduced the number of regenerating myofibers and decreased expression of SC proliferation/differentiation markers (MyoD, myogenin, and active-Notch) after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury in vivo and in SCs cultured in vitro. Ang II depleted the basal pool of SCs, as detected in Myf5(nLacZ/+) mice and by FACS sorting, and this effect was inhibited by Ang II AT1 receptor (AT1R) blockade and in AT1aR-null mice. AT1R was highly expressed in SCs, and Notch activation abrogated the AT1R-mediated antiproliferative effect of Ang II in cultured SCs. In mice that developed CHF postmyocardial infarction, there was skeletal muscle wasting and reduced SC numbers that were inhibited by AT1R blockade. Ang II inhibition of skeletal muscle regeneration via AT1 receptor-dependent suppression of SC Notch and MyoD signaling and proliferation is likely to play an important role in mechanisms leading to cachexia in chronic disease states such as CHF and CKD.

Formation of NORCIS, 3-F-4-OHCIS, and 4-F-2-OHCIS in HLMs exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m): 23.4 +/- 8.6, 32 +/- 11, and 31 +/- 23 microM; V(max): 155 +/- 91, 52 +/- 23, and 31 +/- 23 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). The average in vitro intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) revealed that the formation of NORCIS was 3.9- to 5. 9-fold higher than that of the two hydroxylated metabolites. Formation rate of NORCIS from 10 microM cisapride in 14 HLMs was highly variable (range, 4.9-133.6 pmol/min/mg of protein) and significantly correlated with the activities of CYP3A (r = 0.86, P =. 0001), CYP2C19, and 1A2. Of isoform-specific inhibitors, 1 microM ketoconazole and 50 microM troleandomycin were potent inhibitors of NORCIS formation from 10 microM cisapride (by 51 +/- 9 and 44 +/- 17%, respectively), whereas the effect of other inhibitors was minimal. Of 10 recombinant human CYP450s tested, CYP3A4 formed NORCIS from 10 microM cisapride at the highest rate (V = 0.56 +/- 0. 13 pmol/min/pmol of P450) followed by CYP2C8 (V = 0.29 +/- 0.08 pmol/min/pmol of P450) and CYP2B6 (0.15 +/- 0.04 pmol/min/pmol of P450). The formation of 3-F-4-OHCIS was mainly catalyzed by CYP2C8 (V = 0.71 +/- 0.24 pmol/min/pmol of P450) and that of 4-F-2-OHCIS by CYP3A4 (0.16 +/- 0.03 pmol/min/pmol of P450). Clearly, recombinant CYP2C8 participates in cisapride metabolism, but when the in vitro intrinsic clearances obtained were corrected for abundance of each CYP450 in the liver, CYP3A4 is the dominant isoform. Cisapride was a relatively potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, with no significant effect on other isoforms tested, but the K(i) value derived (14 +/- 16 microM) was much higher than the clinically expected concentration of cisapride (<1 microM). Our data suggest that CYP3A is the main isoform involved in the overall metabolic clearance of cisapride.

We report here tight linkage between MEN2A and D10Z1, as demonstrated by a maximum lod score of 12.02 at the recombination frequency of zero (1-lod-unit support interval 0-4 cM), indicating that the genetic defect in MEN2A lies in the immediate vicinity of the centromere. By means of a set of ordered polymorphic DNA markers from the pericentromeric region, multipoint as well as pairwise linkage analyses place the MEN2A locus at the middle of a small region (approximately 11 cM) bracketing the centromere with FNRB (at 10p11.2) and RBP3 (at 10q11.2) on either side, providing further support for the centromeric location of the MEN2A locus. Marked sex difference in recombination frequencies exists in this pericentromeric region: significantly (P less than .01) more female than male crossovers were observed across all of the adjacent intervals D10S24-FNRB, FNRB-D10Z1, and D10Z1-RBP3. However, a sex difference was not seen in the 7-cM interval from RBP3 to D10S5, suggesting that large variation in the sex difference in recombination can occur over small chromosomal regions.", "meta": {"pmid": 1968709}}
{"text": "Xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) protein is one of the subunits of TFIIH that is required for nucleotide excision repair and transcription. We found a XPD protein complex containing MMS19 that was assumed to be a regulator of TFIIH. However, the MMS19-XPD complex did not contain any other subunits of TFIIH. Instead, it included FAM96B (now designated MIP18), Ciao1, and ANT2. MMS19, MIP18, and XPD localized to the mitotic spindle during mitosis. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMS19, MIP18, or XPD led to improper chromosome segregation and the accumulation of nuclei with abnormal shapes. In addition, the frequency of abnormal mitosis and nuclei was increased in XP-D and XP-D/CS patients' cells. These results indicate that the MMS19-XPD protein complex, now designated MMXD (MMS19-MIP18-XPD), is required for proper chromosome segregation, an abnormality of which could contribute to the pathogenesis in some cases of XP-D and XP-D/CS.", "meta": {"pmid": 20797633}}
{"text": "Ewing family tumors are molecularly characterized by expression of chimeric transcripts generated by specific chromosomal translocations, most commonly involving fusion of the EWS gene to a member of the ETS family of transcription factors (including FLI1, ERG, ETV1, E1AF, and FEV). Approximately 85% of reported cases of Ewing sarcoma bear an EWS-FLI1 fusion. In rare cases, FUS can substitute for EWS, with translocation t(16;21)(p11;q24) producing a FUS-ERG fusion with no EWS rearrangement. We report a case of Ewing sarcoma, presenting as a pathological fracture of the distal clavicle in a 33-year-old male, in which cytogenetic analysis revealed a single t(2;16)(q35;p11) balanced translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a commercially available diagnostic probe was negative for an EWS gene rearrangement; instead, break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for FUS and FEV were positive for a translocation involving these genes. Cloning and sequencing of the breakpoint region demonstrated an in-frame fusion of FUS to FEV. In conclusion, this represents the first reported case of Ewing family tumors demonstrating a variant translocation involving FUS and FEV and highlights the need to consider alternative permutations of fusion partners for molecular diagnosis of sarcomas.", "meta": {"pmid": 17620387}}
{"text": "Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) likely has wide-ranging roles in gene expression and facilitation of tumor cell growth. SRSF3 knockdown induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in colon cancer cells (HCT116) in association with altered expression of 833 genes. Pathway analysis revealed 'G1/S Checkpoint Regulation' as the most highly enriched category in the affected genes. SRSF3 knockdown did not induce p53 or stimulate phosphorylation of p53 or histone H2A.X in wild-type HCT116 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown induced G1 arrest in p53-null HCT116 cells, suggesting that p53-dependent DNA damage responses did not mediate the G1 arrest. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting confirmed that SRSF3 knockdown reduced mRNA and protein levels of cyclins (D1, D3 and E1), E2F1 and E2F7. The decreased expression of cyclin D and E2F1 likely impaired the G1-to-S-phase progression. Consequently, retinoblastoma protein remained hypophosphorylated in SRSF3 knockdown cells. The knockdown also induced apoptosis in association with reduction of BCL2 protein levels. We also found that SRSF3 knockdown facilitated skipping of 81 5'-nucleotides (27 amino acids) from exon 8 of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) and produced a HIPK2 \u0394e8 isoform. Full-length HIPK2 (HIPK2 FL) is constantly degraded through association with an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Siah-1), whereas HIPK2 \u0394e8, lacking the 27 amino acids, lost Siah-1-binding ability and became resistant to proteasome digestion. Interestingly, selective knockdown of HIPK2 FL induced apoptosis in various colon cancer cells expressing wild-type or mutated p53. Thus, these findings disclose an important role of SRSF3 in the regulation of the G1-to-S-phase progression and alternative splicing of HIPK2 in tumor growth. ", "meta": {"pmid": 23503458}}

Also naftifine and terbinafine, two new allylamines, can be used in local therapy of superficial mycotic infections of the skin. Itraconazole and fluconazole are both new triazoles for systemic use. Itraconazole has a broader spectrum and a higher safety profile than ketoconazole, caused by a greater specificity for the fungal cytochrome P 450 14-alpha-demethylase. The pharmacokinetic properties result in shorter treatments, even in onychomycosis. The mode of action of fluconazole is the same as for the azoles.

However, the role of 27-HC in lung adenocarcinoma is still unclear. Because bone metastasis is a main reason for the high mortality of lung adenocarcinoma, this study aimed to investigate the effect of 27-HC on osteoclastogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma microenvironment. The results showed that the conditioned media (CM) from lung adenocarcinoma cells cocultured with macrophages promoted osteoclast differentiation, which was enhanced by 27-HC. Further investigation showed that CM inhibited miR-139 expression and promoted c-Fos expression. Luciferase reporter assay identified c-Fos as a direct target of miR-139. CM also induced the expression and nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, which was enlarged by 27-HC but was attenuated by miR-139. Coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that 27-HC increased the interaction between NFATc1 and phosphorylated STAT3, which was restricted by miR-139. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that pSTAT3 could bind to the promoter of c-Fos, c-Fos could bind to the promoter of NFATc1, and both pSTAT3 and NFATc1 could bind to the promoter of Oscar, which were enlarged by 27-HC but were blocked by miR-139. Knockdown of c-Fos mimicked the effect of miR-139.

{"text": "The primary cilium is critical in sonic hedgehog (Shh)-dependent ventral patterning of the vertebrate neural tube. Most mutants that cause disruption of the cilium result in decreased Shh signaling in the neural tube. In contrast, mutations in the intraflagellar complex A (IFT-A) and the tubby family protein, Tulp3, result in increased Shh signaling in the neural tube. Proteomic analysis of Tulp3-binding proteins first pointed to the role of the IFT-A complex in trafficking Tulp3 into the cilia. Tulp3 directs trafficking of rhodopsin family G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the cilia, suggesting the role of a GPCR in mediating the paradoxical effects of the Tulp3/IFT-A complex in causing increased Shh signaling. Gpr161 has recently been identified as a Tulp3/IFT-A-regulated GPCR that localizes to the primary cilium. A null knock-out mouse model of Gpr161 phenocopies Tulp3 and IFT-A mutants, and causes increased Shh signaling throughout the neural tube. In the absence of Shh, the bifunctional Gli transcription factors are proteolytically processed into repressor forms in a protein kinase A (PKA) -dependent and cilium-dependent manner. Gpr161 activity results in increased cAMP levels in a G\u03b1s -coupled manner, and determines processing of Gli3. Shh signaling also results in removal of Gpr161 from the cilia, suggesting that Gpr161 functions in a positive feedback loop in the Shh pathway. As PKA-null and G\u03b1s mutant embryos also exhibit increased Shh signaling in the neural tube, Gpr161 is a strong candidate for a GPCR that regulates ciliary cAMP levels, and activates PKA in close proximity to the cilia.", "meta": {"pmid": 24917297}}

Contrary to common belief, this disorder is a protean systemic disease, rather than merely a pure digestive alteration. CD is closely associated with genes that code HLA-II antigens, mainly of DQ2 and DQ8 classes. Previously, it was considered to be a rare childhood disorder, but is actually considered a frequent condition, present at any age, which may have multiple complications. Tissue transglutaminase-2 (tTG), appears to be an important component of this disease, both, in its pathogenesis and diagnosis. Active CD is characterized by intestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, and strongly positive tTG auto-antibodies. The duodenal biopsy is considered to be the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis, but its practice has significant limitations in its interpretation, especially in adults. Occasionally, it results in a false-negative because of patchy mucosal changes and the presence of mucosal villous atrophy is often more severe in the proximal jejunum, usually not reached by endoscopic biopsies. CD is associated with increased rates of several diseases, such as iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, dermatitis herpetiformis, several neurologic and endocrine diseases, persistent chronic hypertransami-nasemia of unknown origin, various types of cancer and other autoimmune disorders.

{"text": "According to the different sensitivity of their bone marrow CD34+ cells to in vitro treatment with Etoposide or Mafosfamide, Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) patients in apparent complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy induction may be classified into three groups: (i) normally responsive; (ii) chemoresistant; (iii) highly chemosensitive. This inversely correlates with in vivo CD34+ mobilization and, interestingly, also with the prognosis of the disease: patients showing a good mobilizing activity are resistant to chemotherapy and subject to significantly higher rates of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and relapse than the others. Based on its known role in patients' response to chemotherapy, we hypothesized an involvement of the Apoptotic Machinery (AM) in these phenotypic features. To investigate the molecular bases of the differential chemosensitivity of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in CR AML patients, and the relationship between chemosensitivity, mobilizing activity and relapse rates, we analyzed their AM expression profile by performing Real Time RT-PCR of 84 AM genes in CD34+ pools from the two extreme classes of patients (i.e., chemoresistant and highly chemosensitive), and compared them with normal controls. The AM expression profiles of patients highlighted features that could satisfactorily explain their in vitro chemoresponsive phenotype: specifically, in chemoresistant patients we detected up regulation of antiapoptotic BIRC genes and down regulation of proapoptotic APAF1, FAS, FASL, TNFRSF25. Interestingly, our analysis of the AM network showed that the dysregulated genes in these patients are characterized by high network centrality (i.e., high values of betweenness, closeness, radiality, stress) and high involvement in drug response. AM genes represent critical nodes for the proper execution of cell death following pharmacological induction in patients. We propose that their dysregulation (either due to inborn or de novo genomic mutations selected by treatment) could cause a relapse in apparent CR AML patients. Based on this, AM profiling before chemotherapy and transplantation could identify patients with a predisposing genotype to MRD and relapse: accordingly, they should undergo a different, specifically tailored, therapeutic regimen and should be carefully checked during the post-treatment period.", "meta": {"pmid": 20642818}}
{"text": "Because of two successive rounds of tetraploidization at their inception, the vertebrates contain four times more protein-coding genes in their genome than the invertebrates: 60,000 versus 15,000. Consequently, each invertebrate gene has been amplified to the maximum of four paralogous genes in vertebrates: the one-to-four rule. When this rule is applied to genes pertinent to gonadal development and differentiation, the following emerged: (i) Two closely related zinc-finger transcription factor genes in invertebrates have been amplified to two paralogous groups in vertebrates. One consisted of EGR1, EGR2, EGR3 and EGR4, whereas the only known paralogue of the other is WT1, which controls the developmental fate of the entire nephric system, and therefore of gonads. Interestingly, EGR1 and WT1 act as antagonists of each other in nephroblastic cells. (ii) SF-1, which controls the fate of two steroid hormone-producing organs, adrenals and gonads, is descended from the invertebrate Ftz-F1 gene, and its only known paralogue is GCNF-1. (iii) The Y-linked SRY, the mammalian testis-determining gene, is a paralogue neither of SOX3 (SRX) nor of SOX9. Its ancient origin suggests that SRY once became extinct in earlier vertebrates, only to revive itself in the mammalian ancestor. (iv) Inasmuch as four paralogues of one invertebrate nuclear receptor gene have differentiated to receptors of androgen, mineralocoticoid, glucocorticoid and progesterone, there should at most be four paralogous estrogen-receptor genes in the vertebrate genome.

Consequently, their haploinsufficiency may result in different combinations of clinical alterations, including some of those of WARBM syndrome.

{"text": "Aberrant gene expression that drives human cancer can arise from epigenetic dysregulation. Although much attention has focused on altered activity of transcription factors and chromatin-modulating proteins, proteins that act posttranscriptionally can potently affect expression of oncogenic signaling proteins. The RNA-binding proteins (RBP) Musashi-1 (MSI1) and Musashi-2 (MSI2) are emerging as regulators of multiple critical biological processes relevant to cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Following identification of Musashi as a regulator of progenitor cell identity in Drosophila, the human Musashi proteins were initially linked to control of maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells, then stem cell compartments for additional cell types. More recently, the Musashi proteins were found to be overexpressed and prognostic of outcome in numerous cancer types, including colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers; glioblastoma; and several leukemias. MSI1 and MSI2 bind and regulate the mRNA stability and translation of proteins operating in essential oncogenic signaling pathways, including NUMB/Notch, PTEN/mTOR, TGF\u03b2/SMAD3, MYC, cMET, and others. On the basis of these activities, MSI proteins maintain cancer stem cell populations and regulate cancer invasion, metastasis, and development of more aggressive cancer phenotypes, including drug resistance. Although RBPs are viewed as difficult therapeutic targets, initial efforts to develop MSI-specific inhibitors are promising, and RNA interference-based approaches to inhibiting these proteins have had promising outcomes in preclinical studies.

Pyoderma gangrenosum has recently been included within the spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases, which are characterized by recurrent episodes of sterile inflammation, without circulating autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells. In PAPA syndrome, different mutations involving the PSTPIP1 gene, via an increased binding affinity to pyrin, induce the assembly of inflammasomes. These are molecular platforms involved in the activation of caspase 1, a protease that cleaves inactive prointerleukin (pro-IL)-1\u03b2 to its active isoform IL-1\u03b2. The overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 triggers the release of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are responsible for the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, leading to neutrophil-mediated inflammation. In SAPHO syndrome, the activation of the PSTPIP2 inflammasome has been suggested to play a role in inducing the dysfunction of the innate immune system. Patients with PASH have recently been reported to present alterations of genes involved in well-known autoinflammatory diseases, such as PSTPIP1, MEFV, NOD2 and NLRP3. Pyoderma gangrenosum and its syndromic forms can be regarded as a single clinicopathological spectrum in the context of autoinflammation.", "meta": {"pmid": 27106250}}

However, not all patients harbour demonstrable WDR73 deleterious variants, suggesting that there are other yet unidentified factors contributing to GAMOS aetiology. Autozygosity mapping and candidate analysis was used to identify deleterious variants in consanguineous families. Analysis of patient fibroblasts was used to study splicing and alterations in cellular function. In two consanguineous families with five affected individuals from Turkey with a GAMOS-like presentation, we identified a shared homozygous variant leading to partial exon 4 skipping in nucleoporin, 107-KD (NUP107). The founder mutation was associated with concomitant reduction in NUP107 protein and in the obligate binding partner NUP133 protein, as well as density of nuclear pores in patient cells. Recently, NUP107 was suggested as a candidate in a family with nephrotic syndrome and developmental delay. Other NUP107-reported cases had isolated renal phenotypes. With the addition of these individuals, we implicate an allele-specific critical role for NUP107 in the regulation of brain growth and a GAMOS-like presentation.", "meta": {"pmid": 28280135}}

The expression of SMAD7 is affected by KLF11, which contains gene variants that have previously been shown to be involved in genetic susceptibility to T2D, and by the highly homologous KLF10. This study aims to assess the genetic contribution of SMAD7 and KLF10 gene variants to T2D susceptibility in the French population. We screened both genes to identify rare and frequent variants by direct sequencing and then genotyped these variants. Six frequent variants of SMAD7 and six of KLF10 were analyzed in 349 T2D patients and 349 normoglycaemic adult subjects. Variants with statistically significant differences in allele and/or genotype distribution were further analyzed in a population sample of 1.712 T2D patients and 1.072 normoglycaemic subjects. Two variants showed a significant association under a recessive model: The intronic SMAD7 IVS2 -21 had an odds ratio of 0.62 (P=0.007, 95% CI=0.44-0.88; P=0.034 when adjusting for age, sex and BMI by logistic regression), and the KLF10 3'UTR +1002 variant had an Odds Ratio of 0.81 (P=0.009, 95% CI=0.69-0.95; P=0.042 when adjusting for age, sex and BMI).

{"text": "During apoptosis, endonucleases cleave DNA into 50-300-kb fragments and subsequently into internucleosomal fragments. DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is implicated in apoptotic DNA cleavage; this factor comprises DFF45 and DFF40 subunits, the former of which acts as a chaperone and inhibitor of the catalytic subunit and whose cleavage by caspase-3 results in DFF activation. Disruption of the DFF45 gene blocks internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and confers resistance to apoptosis in primary thymocytes. The role of DFF-mediated DNA fragmentation in apoptosis was investigated in primary fibroblasts from DFF45(-/-) and control (DFF45(+/+)) mice. DFF45 deficiency rendered fibroblasts resistant to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF induced rapid cleavage of DNA into approximately 50-kb fragments in DFF45(+/+) fibroblasts but not in DFF45(-/-) cells, indicating that DFF mediates this initial step in DNA processing. The TNF-induced activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which requires PARP binding to DNA strand breaks, and the consequent depletion of the PARP substrate NAD were markedly delayed in DFF45(-/-) cells, suggesting a role for DFF in PARP activation. The activation of caspase-3 and mitochondrial events important in apoptotic signaling, including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, induced by TNF were similarly delayed in DFF45(-/-) fibroblasts. DFF45(-/-) and DFF45(+/+) cells were equally sensitive to the DNA-damaging agent and PARP activator N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Inhibition of PARP by 3-aminobenzamide partially protected DFF45(+/+) cells against TNF-induced death and inhibited the associated release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. These results suggest that the generation of 50-kb DNA fragments by DFF, together with the activation of PARP, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-3 activation, contributes to an amplification loop in the death process.", "meta": {"pmid": 11461900}}

The literature search (1966-2017) used Embase and PubMed to search medical subject headings that included \"Cesarean Section,\" \"Cesarean Section,\" \"Cesarean Section Delivery\" and all pre- and intraoperative ERAS items. Study selection allowed titles and abstracts to be screened by individual reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles. Metaanalyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled studies, nonrandomized controlled studies, reviews, and case series were considered for each individual topic. Quality assessment and data analyses that evaluated the quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, as used and described in previous ERAS Guidelines. The ERAS Cesarean Delivery Guideline/Pathway has created a maternal focused pathway (for scheduled and unscheduled surgery starting from 30-60 minutes before skin incision to maternal discharge) with ERAS cesarean delivery consensus recommendations preoperative elements (anesthetic medications, fasting, carbohydrate supplementation, prophylactic antibiotics/skin preparation, ), intraoperative elements (anesthetic management, maternal hypothermia prevention, surgical technique, hysterotomy creation and closure, management of peritoneum, subcutaneous space, and skin closure), perioperative fluid management, and postoperative elements (chewing gum, management of nausea and vomiting, analgesia, timing of food intake, glucose management, antithrombotic prophylaxis, timing of ambulation, urinary management, and timing of maternal and neonate discharge). Limited topics for optimized care and for antenatal education and counselling and the immediate neonatal needs at delivery are discussed. Strong recommendations for element use were given for preoperative (antenatal education and counselling, use of antacids and histamine, H2 receptor antagonists, 2-hour fasting and small meal within 6 hours surgery, antimicrobial prophylaxis and skin preparation/chlorhexidine-alcohol), intraoperative (regional anesthesia, prevention of maternal hypothermia [forced warm air, warmed intravenous fluids, room temperature]), perioperative (fluid management for euvolemia and neonatal immediate care needs that include delayed cord clamping), and postoperative (fluid management to prevent nausea and vomiting, antiemetic use, analgesia with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/paracetamol, regular diet within 2 hours, tight capillary glucose control, pneumatic compression stocking for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, immediate removal of urinary catheter). Recommendations against the element use were made for preoperative (maternal sedation, bowel preparation), intraoperative (neonatal oral suctioning or increased inspired oxygen), and postoperative (heparin should not be used routinely venous thromboembolism prophylaxis). Because these ERAS cesarean delivery pathway recommendations (elements/processes) are studied, implemented, audited, evaluated, and optimized by the maternity care teams, this will create an opportunity for the focused and optimized areas of care research with further enhanced care and recommendation.", "meta": {"pmid": 30240657}}
{"text": "In this study we investigated the involvement of p53 in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced tumor target cell killing mediated by the perforin/granzymes pathway. For this purpose we used a human CTL clone (LT12) that kills its autologous melanoma target cells (T1), harboring a wild type p53. We demonstrated initially that LT12 kills its T1 target in a perforin/granzymes-dependent manner. Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis indicated that conjugate formed between LT12 and T1 resulted in rapid cytoplasmic accumulation of p53 and its activation in T1 target cells. Cytotoxic assay using recombinant granzyme B (GrB) showed that this serine protease is the predominant factor inducing such accumulation. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated lowering of the p53 protein in T1 cells or pifithrin-alpha-induced p53-specific inhibition activity significantly decreased CTL-induced target killing mediated by CTL or recombinant GrB. This emphasizes that p53 is an important determinant in granzyme B-induced apoptosis. Our data show furthermore that when T1 cells were treated with streptolysin-O/granzyme B, specific phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-37 residues was observed subsequent to the activation of the stress kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and p38K. Treatment of T1 cells with pifithrin-alpha resulted in inhibition of p53 phosphorylation at these residues and in a significant decrease in GrB-induced apoptotic T1 cell death. Furthermore, small interference RNAs targeting p53 was also accompanied by an inhibition of streptolysin-O/granzyme B-induced apoptotic T1 cell death. The present study supports p53 induction after CTL-induced stress in target cells. These findings provide new insight into a potential role of p53 as a component involved in the dynamic regulation of the major pathway of CTL-mediated cell death and may have therapeutic implications.", "meta": {"pmid": 17855337}}

In the adenohypophysis the characteristics of antagonist binding in ovariectomized female rats, like those in androgenized females, resembled those in normal male rats; this trend was reversed in ovariectomized females after implantation of 17 beta-estradiol capsules, with the characteristics of antagonist binding now resembling those in normal female rats at estrus. Agonist binding characteristics also showed some distinct differences between treated and normal female rats: the proportion of high affinity binding sites decreased both in ovariectomized and androgenized rats, while the affinity of these sites became greater as compared to control animals.

{"text": "We examined the involvement of sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1), which governs the ceramide/sphingosine-1-phosphate balance, in susceptibility to imatinib of either sensitive or resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Imatinib-sensitive LAMA84-s displayed marked SphK1 inhibition coupled with increased content of ceramide and decreased pro-survival sphingosine-1-phosphate. Conversely, no changes in the sphingolipid metabolism were observed in LAMA84-r treated with imatinib. Overcoming imatinib resistance in LAMA84-r with farnesyltransferase or MEK/ERK inhibitors as well as with cytosine arabinoside led to SphK1 inhibition. Overexpression of SphK1 in LAMA84-s cells impaired apoptosis and inhibited the effects of imatinib on caspase-3 activation, cytochrome c and Smac release from mitochondria through modulation of Bim, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SphK1 with F-12509a or its silencing by siRNA induced apoptosis of both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells, suggesting that SphK1 inhibition was critical for apoptosis signaling. We also show that imatinib-sensitive and -resistant primary cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients can be successfully killed in vitro by the F-12509a inhibitor.

However, Nanog is a short-lived protein and quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system. Here we report that the deubiquitinase USP21 interacts with, deubiquitinates and stabilizes Nanog, and therefore maintains the protein level of Nanog in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Loss of USP21 results in Nanog degradation, mESCs differentiation and reduces somatic cell reprogramming efficiency. USP21 is a transcriptional target of the LIF/STAT3 pathway and is downregulated upon differentiation. Moreover, differentiation cues promote ERK-mediated phosphorylation and dissociation of USP21 from Nanog, thus leading to Nanog degradation. In addition, USP21 is recruited to gene promoters by Nanog to deubiquitinate histone H2A at K119 and thus facilitates Nanog-mediated gene expression. Together, our findings provide a regulatory mechanism by which extrinsic signals regulate mESC fate via deubiquitinating Nanog.", "meta": {"pmid": 27886188}}

However, other mediators are being targeted by specific biologic treatments. Among them, the alarmins Il-33 and TSLP, IL-4 and IL-13, eosinophil-related molecules as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and mostly IL-5, and integrins involved in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs), as SIGLEC-8.

We report here the identification of 10 mRNAs that are expressed highly at the Neuro2a differentiated stage.

We also determined how the expression patterns observed correlate with the abilities of neurons in these regions to regenerate axons. Three days to 16 weeks after insertion of living tibial nerve autografts, neurons which had regenerated axons into the graft were retrogradely labelled from the distal extremity of the graft with cholera toxin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and sections through the cerebellum and brainstem were processed for visualization of transported tracer and/or hybridized with riboprobes to detect messenger RNAs for the cell recognition molecules L1 and CHL1 (close homologue of L1), growth-associated protein-43 and the cellular oncogene c-jun. Retrogradely labelled neurons were present in cerebellar deep nuclei close to the graft and in brainstem nuclei known to project to the cerebellum. Neurons in these same nuclei were found to have up-regulated expression of all four messenger RNAs. Individual retrogradely labelled neurons also expressed high levels of L1, CHL1, c-jun or growth-associated protein-43 messenger RNAs (and vice versa), and every messenger RNA investigated was co-localized with at least one other messenger RNA. Purkinje cells did not regenerate axons into the graft or up-regulate L1, CHL1 or growth-associated protein-43 messenger RNAs, but there was increased expression of c-jun messenger RNA in some Purkinje cells close to the graft. Freeze-killed grafts produced no retrograde labelling of neurons, and resulted in only transient and low levels of up-regulation of the tested molecules, mainly L1 and CHL1. These findings show that cerebellar deep nucleus neurons and precerebellar brainstem neurons, but not Purkinje cells, have a high propensity for axon regeneration, and that axonal regeneration by these neurons is accompanied by increased expression of L1, CHL1, c-jun and growth-associated protein-43. Furthermore, although the patterns of expression of the four molecules investigated are not identical in regenerating neuronal populations, it is probable that all four are up-regulated in all neurons whose axons regenerate into the grafts and that their up-regulation may be required for axon regeneration to occur. Finally, because c-jun up-regulation is seen in Purkinje cells close to the graft, unaccompanied by up-regulation of the other molecules investigated, c-jun up-regulation alone cannot be taken to reliably signify a regenerative response to axotomy.", "meta": {"pmid": 10996461}}

Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), D-dimer, and soluble fibrin monomer (sFM) were slightly increased, suggesting that anticoagulant therapy was not completely effective in our Japanese patients based on the values of the TT. The INR was negatively correlated with TT, protein C, and protein S and particularly with TT between 10 and 80%. The range of TT was not correlated with the plasma level of TAT, PPIC, D-dimer, or sFM, but the range of INR was correlated with the plasma level of TAT, D-dimer, and sFM. The percentage of TAT, D-dimer, and sFM within normal range was significantly lower in patients with high INR. These findings show that INR is better than TT for the monitoring of warfarin therapy and that the therapeutic values of INR during the anticoagulant therapy should be > 1.7 in Japanese patients.", "meta": {"pmid": 10805292}}
{"text": "The possible reason for the significantly greater AUC of oral warfarin with oral oxolamine in male Sprague-Dawley rats was evaluated. After oral administration of warfarin at a dose of 2 mg/kg to male rats with oxolamine at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, the AUC values of warfarin were significantly greater than the controls (254 and 330 versus 180 microg h/ml). However, the AUC values of warfarin were not affected by oxolamine in female rats. This could be due to inhibition of CYP2B1, 2C11 and 3A2 by oxolamine in male rats, since warfarin was metabolized via CYP1A1, 2B1, 2C6, 2C11 and 3A2 in rats and CYP2B1 is male dominant, and CYP2C11 and 3A2 are male specific. Therefore, phenytoin, torasemide and clarithromycin (mainly metabolized via CYP2B1/2, 2C11 and 3A2 in rats, respectively) were administered intravenously to male rats with or without oral oxolamine. After oral oxolamine at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, the AUC of phenytoin was significantly greater (1280 and 1640 versus 938 microg min/ml), however, the AUC values of torasemide and clarithromycin were independent of oxolamine.

{"text": "The Ca2+-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CADPS2) is a member of the CAPS/CADPS protein family that plays crucial roles in synaptic vesicle dynamics. Genomic variability in the CADPS2 gene has been associated to autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease, both characterized by altered neurotransmission. Biological evidence also linked CADPS2 to Parkinson's disease (PD), as a disease-causing mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) was reported to increase CADPS2 gene and protein expression. Furthermore, restoration of CADPS2 physiologic levels was able to provide neuroprotection in patient-derived neurons, consistent with the synaptic dysfunction postulated to underlie PD. However, little is known about the influence of PD-related proteins on transcriptional regulation of critical synaptic genes such as CADPS2. Here we aimed at investigating the transcriptional effects of LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein (aSyn) on CADPS2 gene expression, using a combination of in silico analyses and cell biology techniques. First, we identified a predicted promoter in the human CADPS2 genomic sequence, which we then utilized in a luciferase-based gene reporter assay. This approach enabled us to disclose a differential effect of high levels of LRRK2 and aSyn on CADPS2 promoter activity. Specifically, CADPS2 transcriptional activity was enhanced by high cellular levels of LRRK2 and reduced by overexpression of aSyn. Consistently, CADPS2 mRNA levels were diminished in aSyn overexpressing cells. Our results indicate that LRRK2 and aSyn participate in the dysregulation of CADPS2 by altering transcription and support the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunctions, through different mechanisms, might contribute to the neuronal defects of diseases such as PD.", "meta": {"pmid": 28647363}}

These interactions all require Ras-GTP with an intact effector binding domain (Switch I region). We have examined the requirements of the Switch II region (amino acids 60-72) for the production of stable interactions between Ras and its downstream effectors. A point mutation at position 65 or 64 combined with additional mutations at either position 65 or 71 rendered nucleotide-free Ras protein unable to stably interact with Ras specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Ha-Ras containing point mutations at positions 65 and 71 possessed a twofold higher affinity for B-raf and consequently MEK1. The point mutation at 64, in combination with additional point mutations at either position 65 or 71, resulted in a protein which failed to interact with either PI-3 kinase or neurofibromin, though these Ras mutants effectively bound both Raf-1 and B-raf. An activated form of Ras, Q61L-Ras, associated with all effector proteins independent of the bound guanine nucleotide. Q61L-Ras-GDP was almost as effective as wild type Ras-GMPPNP in the in vitro activation of MEK1 and MAP kinase. Competitive studies with the catalytic domain if neurofibromin, NF1-GRD, demonstrated that its interaction with Ras-GMPPNP is mutually exclusive with both Raf-1 and B-raf.

{"text": "CDK16 (also known as PCTAIRE1 or PCTK1) is an atypical member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family that forms an active complex with cyclin Y (CCNY). Although both proteins have been recently implicated in cancer pathogenesis, it is still unclear how the CDK16/CCNY complex exerts its biological activity. To understand the CDK16/CCNY network, we used complementary proteomic approaches to identify potential substrates of this complex. We identified several candidates implicating the CDK16/CCNY complex in cytoskeletal dynamics, and we focused on the microtubule-associated protein regulator of cytokinesis (PRC1), an essential protein for cell division that organizes antiparallel microtubules and whose deregulation may drive genomic instability in cancer. Using analog-sensitive (AS) CDK16 generated by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in 293T cells, we found that specific inhibition of CDK16 induces PRC1 dephosphorylation at Thr481 and delocalization to the nucleus during interphase. The observation that CDK16 inhibition and PRC1 downregulation exhibit epistatic effects on cell viability confirms that these proteins can act through a single pathway. In conclusion, we identified PRC1 as the first substrate of the CDK16/CCNY complex and demonstrated that the proliferative function of CDK16 is mediated by PRC1 phosphorylation. As CDK16 is emerging as a critical node in cancer, our study reveals novel potential therapeutic targets.", "meta": {"pmid": 30992425}}

To address this issue, we created a recessive loss-of-function variant of Fnip1 Homozygous FNIP1 deficiency resulted in profound B-cell deficiency, partially restored by overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2, whereas heterozygous deficiency caused a loss of marginal zone B cells. FNIP1-deficient mice developed cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy and glycogen accumulation, with close parallels to mice and humans bearing gain-of-function mutations in the \u03b32 subunit of AMPK.

{"text": "Wnt ligands have pleiotropic and context-specific roles in embryogenesis and adult tissues. Among other effects, certain Wnts stabilize the beta-catenin protein, leading to the ability of beta-catenin to activate T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated transcription. Mutations resulting in constitutive beta-catenin stabilization underlie development of several human cancers. Genetic studies in Drosophila highlighted the split ends (spen) gene as a positive regulator of Wnt-dependent signaling. We have assessed the role of SHARP, a human homologue of spen, in Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF function in mammalian cells. We found that SHARP gene and protein expression is elevated in human colon and ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas and mouse colon adenomas and carcinomas carrying gene defects leading to beta-catenin dysregulation. When ectopically expressed, the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors/histone deacetylase 1-associated repressor protein (SHARP) protein potently enhanced beta-catenin/TCF transcription of a model reporter gene and cellular target genes. Inhibition of endogenous SHARP function via RNA inhibitory (RNAi) approaches antagonized beta-catenin/TCF-mediated activation of target genes. The effect of SHARP on beta-catenin/TCF-regulated genes was mediated via a functional interaction between SHARP and TCF. beta-Catenin-dependent neoplastic transformation of RK3E cells was enhanced by ectopic expression of SHARP, and RNAi-mediated inhibition of endogenous SHARP in colon cancer cells inhibited their transformed growth.

To account for missing scores and scores obtained after rescue, switch or discontinuation of study drug, data were analysed using (1) linear extrapolation (LE) and (2) observed/last\u2009observation carried forward (LOCF). The observed/LOCF method used all available observed data, including after rescue or switch, with patients analysed according to original treatment assignment. Using LE, radiographic progression at 24 and 48 weeks was statistically significantly lower for both baricitinib 2 or 4\u2009mg compared with placebo. Only baricitinib 4\u2009mg demonstrated statistically significant inhibition of progressive radiographic joint damage compared with patients initially randomised to placebo using observed/LOCF at week 48. Once daily oral baricitinib inhibited radiographic progression of structural joint damage in patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to csDMARDs over 48 weeks.

{"text": "By using a combination of array comparative genomic hybridization and a candidate gene approach, we identified nuclear factor I/X (NFIX) deletions or nonsense mutation in three sporadic cases of a Sotos-like overgrowth syndrome with advanced bone age, macrocephaly, developmental delay, scoliosis, and unusual facies. Unlike the aforementioned human syndrome, Nfix-deficient mice are unable to gain weight and die in the first 3 postnatal weeks, while they also present with a spinal deformation and decreased bone mineralization. These features prompted us to consider NFIX as a candidate gene for Marshall-Smith syndrome (MSS), a severe malformation syndrome characterized by failure to thrive, respiratory insufficiency, accelerated osseous maturation, kyphoscoliosis, osteopenia, and unusual facies. Distinct frameshift and splice NFIX mutations that escaped nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) were identified in nine MSS subjects. NFIX belongs to the Nuclear factor one (NFI) family of transcription factors, but its specific function is presently unknown. We demonstrate that NFIX is normally expressed prenatally during human brain development and skeletogenesis. These findings demonstrate that allelic NFIX mutations trigger distinct phenotypes, depending specifically on their impact on NMD.", "meta": {"pmid": 20673863}}
{"text": "The transcription factor Ptf1a is a crucial helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein selectively expressed in the pancreas, retina, spinal cord, brain, and enteric nervous system. Ptf1a is preferably assembled into a transcription trimeric complex PTF1 with an E protein and Rbpj (or Rbpjl). In pancreatic development, Ptf1a is indispensable in controlling the expansion of multipotent progenitor cells as well as the specification and maintenance of the acinar cells. In neural tissues, Ptf1a is transiently expressed in the post-mitotic cells and specifies the inhibitory neuronal cell fates, mostly mediated by downstream genes such as Tfap2a/b and Prdm13. Mutations in the coding and non-coding regulatory sequences resulting in Ptf1a gain- or loss-of-function are associated with genetic diseases such as pancreatic and cerebellar agenesis in the rodent and human. Surprisingly, Ptf1a alone is sufficient to reprogram mouse or human fibroblasts into tripotential neural stem cells.

{"text": "Desert hedgehog (DHH) belongs to the hedgehog gene family that act as secreted intercellular signal transducers. DHH is an essential morphogen for normal testicular development and function in both mice and humans but is not present in the avian lineage. Like other hedgehog proteins, DHH signals through the patched (PTCH) receptors 1 and 2. Here we examine the expression and protein distribution of DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 in the developing testes of a marsupial mammal (the tammar wallaby) to determine whether DHH signalling is a conserved factor in gonadal development in all therian mammals. DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 were present in the marsupial genome and highly conserved with their eutherian orthologues. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that DHH has recently evolved and is a mammal-specific hedgehog orthologue. The marsupial PTCH2 receptor had an additional exon (exon 21a) not annotated in eutherian PTCH2 proteins. Interestingly we found evidence of this exon in humans and show that its translation would result in a truncated protein with functions similar to PTCH1. We also show that DHH expression was not restricted to the testes during gonadal development (as in mice), but was also expressed in the developing ovary. Expression of DHH, PTCH1 and PTCH2 in the adult tammar testis and ovary was consistent with findings in the adult mouse. These data suggest that there is a highly conserved role for DHH signalling in the differentiation and function of the mammalian testis and that DHH may be necessary for marsupial ovarian development. The receptors PTCH1 and PTCH2 are highly conserved mediators of hedgehog signalling in both the developing and adult marsupial gonads. Together these findings indicate DHH is an essential therian mammal-specific morphogen in gonadal development and gametogenesis.", "meta": {"pmid": 22132805}}

{"text": "There is a lack of personalized treatment options for women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Outside of bevacizumab and a group of poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, few options are available to women that relapse. We propose that efficacious drug combinations can be determined via molecular characterization of ovarian tumors along with pre-established pharmacogenomic profiles of repurposed compounds. To that end, we selectively performed multiple two-drug combination treatments in ovarian cancer cell lines that included reactive oxygen species inducers and HSP90 inhibitors. This allowed us to select cell lines that exhibit disparate phenotypes of proliferative inhibition to a specific drug combination of auranofin and AUY922. We profiled altered mechanistic responses from these agents in both reactive oxygen species and HSP90 pathways, as well as investigated PRKCI and lncRNA expression in ovarian cancer cell line models. Generation of dual multi-gene panels implicated in resistance or sensitivity to this drug combination was produced using RNA sequencing data and the validity of the resistant signature was examined using high-density RT-qPCR. Finally, data mining for the prevalence of these signatures in a large-scale clinical study alluded to the prevalence of resistant genes in ovarian tumor biology.

{"text": "During activation of platelets by agonists, a number of proteins become phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. Using immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we have compared the different phosphotyrosine-protein (PTP) profiles of platelets stimulated with thrombin, collagen, ADP, arachidonic acid, phorbol myristate acetate and P256, an anti-glycoprotein-IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Only a few PTPs were observed in resting platelets, of molecular masses 130, 64, 56-60 and 36 kDa. After stimulation by different agonists these proteins were more intensely phosphorylated and additional PTPs appeared with molecular masses of 170, 150, 140, 120, 105/97 (doublet), 85, 80, 75 and 45 kDa. The kinetics of phosphorylation differed from one agonist to another, but no significant differences in the overall patterns were detected, except in presence of ADP and P256-F(ab')2, which induced only the additional tyrosine phosphorylation of the 64 kDa protein and to a lesser extent that of a 75 kDa protein. The use of various agonists and the inhibitors (staurosporine, ajoene and RGDS) permitted a better characterization of the relationship between the different steps of activation and phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. The studies suggest the following conclusions: (i) stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation occurs after activation of protein kinase C; (ii) there is a relationship between ligand binding to GPIIb-IIIa and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 64 kDa protein; and (iii) there is a close relationship between PTP formation and the intensity of platelet activation and aggregation.", "meta": {"pmid": 1622407}}
{"text": "Obesity and the metabolic syndrome have evolved to be major health issues throughout the world. Whether loss of genome integrity contributes to this epidemic is an open question. DNA polymerase \u03b7 (pol \u03b7), encoded by the xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-V) gene, plays an essential role in preventing cutaneous cancer caused by UV radiation-induced DNA damage. Herein, we demonstrate that pol \u03b7 deficiency in mice (pol \u03b7(-/-)) causes obesity with visceral fat accumulation, hepatic steatosis, hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance. In comparison to WT mice, adipose tissue from pol \u03b7(-/-) mice exhibits increased DNA damage and a greater DNA damage response, indicated by up-regulation and/or phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), and poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1). Concomitantly, increased cellular senescence in the adipose tissue from pol \u03b7(-/-) mice was observed and measured by up-regulation of senescence markers, including p53, p16(Ink4a), p21, senescence-associated (SA) \u03b2-gal activity, and SA secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) as early as 4 wk of age. Treatment of pol \u03b7(-/-) mice with a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-\u03b1, reduced adipocyte senescence and attenuated the metabolic abnormalities. Furthermore, elevation of adipocyte DNA damage with a high-fat diet or sodium arsenite exacerbated adipocyte senescence and metabolic abnormalities in pol \u03b7(-/-) mice. In contrast, reduction of adipose DNA damage with N-acetylcysteine or metformin ameliorated cellular senescence and metabolic abnormalities. These studies indicate that elevated DNA damage is a root cause of adipocyte senescence, which plays a determining role in the development of obesity and insulin resistance.", "meta": {"pmid": 26240351}}

We have constructed a novel breast cancer vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)-hIL2MUC1, that consists of BCG and expresses a truncated form of MUC1 and human interleukin (IL)-2. In vitro analysis of the BCG-hIL2MUC1 construct confirmed coexpression of MUC1 and human IL-2. The ability of BCG-hIL2MUC1 to inhibit breast cancer growth was evaluated in hu-PBL-SCID mice (severe combined immunodeficient mice reconstituted with 50 x 10(6) human peripheral blood lymphocytes) that received three biweekly injections of BCG-hIL2MUC1 (0.5 colony-forming unit). Control animals received PBS, MUC1 peptide (100 microg), or empty vector BCG-261 (0.5 colony-forming unit) vaccination. After immunization, hu-PBL-SCID mice (n = 8 in each group) were xenografted with 4 x 10(6) ZR75-1 human breast cancer cells. Whereas mice receiving the control vaccines developed a tumor, only 87% of BCG-hIL2MUC1-immunized animals developed a palpable tumor with a slower rate of tumor growth (P < 0.001). Histological analysis of the primary tumors in BCG-hIL2MUC1-immunized animals revealed areas of reduced MUC1 expression. CD8-positive human lymphocytes were detected only in tumors grown in BCG-hIL2MUC1-immunized animals. These results imply a critical role of coexpressed IL-2 and MUC1 in eliciting tumor-specific immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of BCG engineered to express a tumor-associated antigen.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was used as a marker of cell death and analysis of genomic DNA for internucleosomal cleavage was used as a marker of endonuclease activation. Aurintricarboxylic acid and 3-aminobenzamide had no effect on the proximal tubule LDH release produced by 1 h exposure to antimycin A, FCCP, or ionomycin, or 2 h exposure to TBHP. Furthermore, there was no evidence of DNA fragmentation with any compound prior to or after cell death began. As a positive control, proximal tubules exposed to digitonin in the absence of metabolic substrates resulted in the chelator-inhibitable fragmentation of DNA, indicating that the endonuclease is present in proximal tubules. These results show that endonuclease activation did not occur prior to or after cell death began.

We describe a prenatally suspected case of CHARGE syndrome due to unique findings of cardiac defects (DORV) in combination with minor clues, including a structurally malformed ear with persistent non-response to an acoustic stimulation (which has never been prenatally described elsewhere), renal malrotation and growth restriction. Postnatal diagnosis was made based on confirmation of the prenatal findings and additional specific findings of bilateral coloboma, choanal atresia and ear canal stenosis.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effect of eluxadoline on work productivity and HRQOL in patients with IBS-D with previous inadequate response to loperamide. METHODS: The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for IBS-D (WPAI:IBS-D), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Healthy Days Core Module (CDC HRQOL-4), and EuroQoL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) instruments were administered at baseline and week 12 of a phase 4 clinical trial (RELIEF), assessing the efficacy and safety of eluxadoline treatment in adults with IBS-D reporting previous inadequate response to loperamide. Changes from baseline to week 12 for each assessment were evaluated using an analysis of covariance model. Indirect costs were calculated by converting overall work productivity losses into monetary values. RESULTS: A total of 346 patients were randomized to either eluxadoline (n = 172) or placebo (n = 174). From baseline to week 12, compared with placebo, twice-daily treatment with eluxadoline resulted in significantly greater reductions in absenteeism (2.6%; P = 0.046). Numerically greater decreases in presenteeism, overall work productivity loss, and daily activity impairment were also observed in patients receiving eluxadoline compared with those receiving placebo (P = not significant for each). Numerical reductions in overall work productivity loss from baseline to week 12 translate to approximately 2.4 hours per patient per week (123 hours annually) and correspond to an avoided overall work loss of $4,503 annually for an employee with IBS-D treated with eluxadoline. In addition, from baseline to week 12, treatment with eluxadoline led to a significantly greater reduction in the number of unhealthy days experienced (-1.7 days; P = 0.042), as well as numerical improvements in EQ-5D measures in comparison with placebo (P = not significant for each). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with IBS-D reporting inadequate response to loperamide, eluxadoline treatment was associated with significant reductions in absenteeism and the number of unhealthy days experienced. Eluxadoline treatment of IBS-D may lead to significant cost savings via mitigation of losses in work productivity.

Targeted sequencing of 409 genes in tissue samples of 18 long-standing UC subjects at high risk of colorectal carcinoma (UCHR) was performed to identify somatic driver mutations, which may be involved in the molecular changes during the transformation of non-dysplastic mucosa to high-grade dysplasia. Findings from the study are also compared with previously published genome wide and exome sequencing data in inflammatory bowel disease-associated and sporadic colorectal carcinoma. Next-generation sequencing analysis identified 1107 mutations in 275 genes in UCHR subjects. In addition to TP53 (17%) and KRAS (22%) mutations, recurrent mutations in APC (33%), ACVR2A (61%), ARID1A (44%), RAF1 (39%) and MTOR (61%) were observed in UCHR subjects. In addition, APC, FGFR3, FGFR2 and PIK3CA driver mutations were identified in UCHR subjects. Recurrent mutations in ARID1A (44%), SMARCA4 (17%), MLL2 (44%), MLL3 (67%), SETD2 (17%) and TET2 (50%) genes involved in histone modification and chromatin remodelling were identified in UCHR subjects. Our study identifies new oncogenic driver mutations which may be involved in the transition of non-dysplastic cells to dysplastic phenotype in the subjects with long-standing UC with high risk of progression into colorectal neoplasia.", "meta": {"pmid": 28524162}}
{"text": "Few data exist on the distribution of pharmaceutical costs for inpatient surgical procedures across different drug categories (eg, analgesia, anti-infectives). The goals of this study were to categorize pharmaceuticals administered to patients after joint replacement surgery and then to take the hospital's perspective and quantify the pharmacy cost of delivering postoperative analgesia to these patients. Two hundred ninety-eight patients undergoing unilateral hip replacement (n = 145), unilateral knee replacement (n = 121), or bilateral knee replacement (n = 32) were studied retrospectively. For each patient, we determined what hospital resources (eg, supplies) were utilized by each patient in each of 12 different hospital departments. This was done to determine what fraction of overall hospital costs was incurred as a result of pharmacy. Then, we classified the hundreds of items (from acetaminophen to warfarin) included as pharmacy costs into 1 of the following categories: postoperative epidural analgesia, opioids, nonopioids, respiratory, gastrointestinal, naloxone, anti-infective, anticoagulant/antiplatelets, miscellaneous, cardiovascular, pharmacist clinical intervention, intravenous fluids, and benzodiazepines. The pharmacy costs for epidural analgesia, opioids, and nonopioids were summed to compute the fraction of pharmacy costs attributed to postoperative analgesia. The results showed that 3.3% (95% confidence interval CI, 2.7% to 3.6%) of total hospitalization costs were pharmacy costs, which averaged 560 US dollars (95% CI, 500 US dollars to 620 US dollars) for hip replacement, 595 US dollars (95% CI, 551 to 639 US dollars) for knee replacement, and 922 US dollars (95% CI, 588 US dollars to 1256 US dollars) for bilateral knee replacement surgery. An average of 9.9% (95% CI, 7.37% to 12.43%) of total pharmacy costs for the 3 surgery types were for postoperative epidural analgesia, whereas opioids averaged 19.9% (95% CI, 18.67% to 21.13%), and nonopioids averaged 0.8% (95% CI 0.65% to 0.95%) of pharmacy costs. Thus, analgesics accounted for approximately 31% of pharmacy costs. The pharmacy cost of delivering postoperative analgesia to patients undergoing joint replacement surgery represents 1% of the total costs of surgery. Almost two thirds of the analgesic costs were for opioids.", "meta": {"pmid": 14622724}}
{"text": "Erythromycin has been reported to interact with the anticonvulsant, carbamazepine, in both children and adults. Toxic serum levels of carbamazepine are observed within 24 h of antibiotic administration, suggesting a mechanism not previously described for other erythromycin-based drug interactions. In rats erythromycin significantly depressed the elimination of carbamazepine in animals induced with carbamazepine for 4 days but had no effect on carbamazepine elimination in noninduced animals. Although the in vitro metabolism of carbamazepine to its epoxide by hepatic microsomes prepared from noninduced rats was significantly inhibited by erythromycin, the inhibition of carbamazepine epoxidation was greatly enhanced in carbamazepine-induced rats. In the pig the sensitivity of carbamazepine metabolism to erythromycin was much greater than in the rat, indicating the existence of a large species difference in this particular drug interaction. It is concluded that the interaction between erythromycin and carbamazepine is caused by a direct inhibition of carbamazepine oxidation by the antibiotic.", "meta": {"pmid": 2776076}}
{"text": "Nucleolin (NCL) is the most abundant RNA-binding protein in the cell nucleolus and plays an important role in chromatin stability, ribosome assembly, ribosomal RNA maturation, ribosomal DNA transcription, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and regulation of RNA stability and translation efficiency. In addition to its anti-apoptotic properties, the underlying mechanisms associated with NCL-related roles in different cellular processes remain unclear. In this study, the effect of NCL on microRNA (miRNA) expression was evaluated by generating transgenic mice with myocardial overexpression of NCL and by analyzing microarrays of mature and precursor miRNAs from mice. Using microinjection of alpha-MyHc clone 26-NCL plasmids, we generated transgenic mice with myocardial overexpression of NCL firstly, and then mature and precursor miRNAs expression profiles were analyzed in NCL transgenic mice (n = 3) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 3) by miRNA microarrays. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform Student's t-test, and statistical significance was determined at P < 0.05. Several miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed, of which 11 were upregulated and 4 were downregulated in transgenic mice with myocardial overexpression of NCL compared to those in WT mice. Several differentially expressed miRNAs were subsequently confirmed and quantified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics analysis was used for the prediction of miRNA targets. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that NCL regulated miR-21 expression following hydrogen peroxide preconditioning. Myocardial-protection mechanisms exerted by NCL might be mediated by the miRNAs identified in this study.", "meta": {"pmid": 29363650}}

{"text": "Three different syndromes produced by congeners of morphine have been identified in the nondependent chronic spinal dog. These syndromes have been attributed to interaction of agonists with three distinguishable receptors (mu, kappa and sigma). Morphine is the prototype agonist for the mu receptor, ketocyclazocine for the kappa receptor and SKF-10,047 for the sigma receptor. The morphine syndrome (mu) in the dog is characterized by miosis, bradycardia, hypothermia, a general depression of the nociceptive responses and indifference to environmental stimuli. Ketocyclazocine (kappa) constricts pupils, depresses the flexor reflex and produces sedation but does not markedly alter pulse rate or the skin twitch reflex. SKF-10,047 (sigma), in contrast to morphine and ketocyclazocine, causes mydriasis, tachypnea, tachycardia and mania. The effects of these three drugs can be antagonized by the pure antagonist naltrexone, indicating that they are agonists. Further, chronic administration of morphine, ketocyclazocine and SKF-10,047 induces tolerance to their agonistic effects. Morphine suppresses abstinence in morphine-dependent dogs while ketocyclazocine does not. Ketocyclazocine at best precipitated only a liminal abstinence syndrome in the morphine-dependent dog, indicating that it had little affinity for the morphine receptor. Ketocyclazocine thus appears to be a selective agonist at the kappa receptor. Further, it has been shown that buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the mu type which both suppressed and precipitated abstinence in the morphine-dependent dog while morphine and propoxyphene are stronger agonists. Apomorphine and SKF-10,047 produce similar pharmacologic effects suggesting that sigma activity may involve a dopaminergic mechanism.", "meta": {"pmid": 945347}}

Multiple clinical variants are caused by more than 400 mutations in at least 14 different genes. These progressive genetic disorders primarily manifest in the central nervous system because of an extensive loss of neurons, specifically in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. Patients with mutations in CLN1, which encodes palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), primarily manifest with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Haltia-Santavuori disease). Affected children usually present between 1 and 2 years of age and typically die by 8 to 13 years of age. We describe a patient with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with a novel c.776_777insA mutation in CLN1.

Our study exposed a novel missense homozygous mutation NC_000019.9:g.41209497C\u2009>\u2009T; NM_024876.4:c.748G\u2009>\u2009A; NP_079152.3:p.(Asp250Asn) in the 9th exon of the COQ8B gene, co-segregated well with the disease phenotype. Our study provides the first insight into this homozygous condition, which has not been previously reported in 1000Genome, ClinVar, ExAC, and genomAD databases. In addition to the pathogenic COQ8B variant, the WES data also revealed some novel and recurrent mutations in the GLA, NUP107, COQ2, COQ6, COQ7 and COQ9 genes.

{"text": "Variants in the ryanodine receptor-1 gene (RYR1) have been associated with a wide range of neuromuscular conditions, including various congenital myopathies and malignant hyperthermia (MH). More recently, a number of RYR1 variants, mostly MH-associated, have been demonstrated to contribute to rhabdomyolysis events not directly related to anesthesia in otherwise healthy individuals. This review focuses on RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis in the context of several clinical presentations (i.e., exertional rhabdomyolysis, exertional heat illnesses and MH), and conditions involving a similar hypermetabolic state, in which RYR1 variants may be present (i.e., neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome). The variety of triggers that can evoke rhabdomyolysis, on their own or in combination, as well as the number of potentially associated complications, illustrates that this is a condition relevant to several medical disciplines. External triggers include but are not limited to strenuous physical exercise, especially if unaccustomed or performed under challenging environmental conditions (e.g., high ambient temperature or humidity), alcohol/illicit drugs, prescription medication (in particular statins, other anti-lipid agents, antipsychotics and antidepressants) infection, or heat. Amongst all patients presenting with rhabdomyolysis, genetic susceptibility is present in a proportion, with RYR1 being one of the most common genetic causes. Clinical clues for a genetic susceptibility include recurrent rhabdomyolysis, creatine kinase (CK) levels above 50 times the upper limit of normal, hyperCKemia lasting for 8 weeks or longer, drug/medication doses insufficient to explain the rhabdomyolysis event, and positive family history. For the treatment or prevention of RYR1-related rhabdomyolysis, the RYR1 antagonist dantrolene can be administered, both in the acute phase or prophylactically in patients with a history of muscle cramps and/or recurrent rhabdomyolysis events. Aside from dantrolene, several other drugs are being investigated for their potential therapeutic use in RYR1-related disorders.

Marijuana use was defined based on the Addiction Severity Index as current use (within 30 d), recent use (use in last year), and increased use (increased use since surgery). Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact tests and linear regression methods adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, time since surgery, and change in body mass index. The majority of the sample was female (76%) and underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (62%). Eighteen percent (18%) of the sample reported current marijuana use; 38% reported recent use; and 21.4% reported increased use post-WLS. A loss of controlled food intake was associated with current (P = .02) and increased post-WLS use (P = .01). Increased use and/or regular marijuana use predicted higher scores on eating disorder subscales compared with respective counterparts (P<.05). Current use did not significantly predict higher scores on the Yale Food Addiction Scale. Findings indicated marijuana use in post-WLS patients despite recommendations against use.

It contains seven Ca(2+) ions. Four of them (Ca2-Ca5) are responsible for folding of Tk-subtilisin. In this study, to clarify the role of the other three Ca(2+) ions (Ca1, Ca6, and Ca7), we constructed Pro-TKS derivatives lacking the Ca1 ion (Pro-TKS/\u0394Ca1), Ca6 ion (Pro-TKS/\u0394Ca6), and Ca7 ion (Pro-TKS/\u0394Ca7), and their active site mutants (Pro-S324A/\u0394Ca1, Pro-S324A/\u0394Ca6, and Pro-S324A/\u0394Ca7, respectively). Pro-TKS/\u0394Ca6 and Pro-TKS/\u0394Ca7 fully matured into their active forms upon incubation at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min as did Pro-TKS. The mature enzymes were as active as Tk-subtilisin at 80 \u00b0C, indicating that the Ca6 and Ca7 ions are not important for activity. In contrast, Pro-TKS/\u0394Ca1 matured poorly at 80 \u00b0C because of the instability of its mature domain. The enzymatic activity of Tk-subtilisin/\u0394Ca1 was determined to be 50% of that of Tk-subtilisin using the refolded protein. This result suggests that the Ca1 ion is required for the maximal activity of Tk-subtilisin. The refolding rates of all Pro-S324A derivatives were comparable to that of Pro-S324A (active site mutant of Pro-TKS), indicating that these Ca(2+) ions are not needed for folding of Tk-subtilisin. The stabilities of Pro-S324A/\u0394Ca1 and Pro-S324A/\u0394Ca6 were decreased by 26.6 and 11.7 \u00b0C, respectively, in T(m) compared to that of Pro-S324A. The half-lives of Tk-subtilisin/\u0394Ca6 and Tk-subtilisin/\u0394Ca7 at 95 \u00b0C were 8- and 4-fold lower than that of Tk-subtilisin, respectively.

{"text": "Although the overall incidence of infective endocarditis in the paediatric population is considered to be low, over the last 20 years a rising trend in infective endocarditis has been observed among children. This could be due to several reasons including the availability of improved diagnostic techniques, use of continuous central venous catheters and cardiac implants increasing the risk of infection, and the survival of a greater number of infants with congenital heart disease as a result of improved medical management. The predominant causative organisms of paediatric endocarditis include staphylococci and streptococci. There is increased concern surrounding the emergence of endocarditis in children caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and drug resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The treatment approach to paediatric endocarditis is similar to that for adult patients with endocarditis because of similarities in disease pathogenesis and aetiology. The therapeutic goal is to achieve sterilisation of the cardiac vegetations. The choice of antibacterial is dependent upon the susceptibility profile of the causative organism. Vancomycin or gentamicin is recommended for enterococcal endocarditis, according to guidelines from the American Heart Association. For staphylococcal endocarditis in patients with no prosthetic valve, oxacillin or nafcillin with or without gentamicin is the treatment of choice. In the case of endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin is commonly used in patients with no prosthetic valve and a combination of vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampicin (rifampin) for patients with prosthetic material. Cefazolin or ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for penicillin allergic paediatric patients with endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci. While there have been no major changes in endocarditis therapy for the last decade, the current focus is on the recognition of multiple-drug resistant pathogens and the use of newer agents such as quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of resistant bacterial endocarditis. Prophylactic antibacterial therapy is recommended for procedures thought to be associated with the occurrence of bacteraemia involving organisms commonly associated with endocarditis. These include dental extractions and oral, respiratory tract, genitourinary, gastrointestinal or oesophageal procedures. Prophylactic antibacterials recommended by the American Heart Association during genitourinary and gastrointestinal surgical procedures in high risk patients include ampicillin + gentamicin or vancomycin + gentamicin in high risk patients with penicillin allergy. Ampicillin has been recommended for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in children undergoing oral, respiratory tract or oesophageal procedures. In the case of penicillin allergy in these patients, cephalosporins, clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin have been recommended.

Primary care physicians' medical records and administrative claims containing reimbursements for filled prescriptions, laboratory tests, and hospitalisations were evaluated using a three-tier triage system of detection, filtering, and substantiation that generated a list of drugs potentially associated with AMI. Outcome of interest was statistically significant increased risk of AMI during drug exposure that has not been previously described in current literature and is biologically plausible. Overall, 163 drugs were identified to be associated with increased risk of AMI during preliminary screening. Of these, 124 drugs were eliminated after adjustment for possible bias and confounding. With subsequent application of criteria for novelty and biological plausibility, association with AMI remained for nine drugs ('prime suspects'): azithromycin; erythromycin; roxithromycin; metoclopramide; cisapride; domperidone; betamethasone; fluconazole; and megestrol acetate. Although global health status, co-morbidities, and time-invariant factors were adjusted for, residual confounding cannot be ruled out.

{"text": "Long chain alkylphenols are man-made compounds still present in industrial and agricultural processes. Their main use is domestic and they are widespread in household products, cleansers and cosmetics, leading to a global environmental and human contamination. These molecules are known to exert estrogen-like activities through binding to classical estrogen receptors. In vitro, they can also interact with the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor. Testicular germ cell tumor etiology and progression are proposed to be stimulated by lifelong estrogeno-mimetic exposure. We studied the transduction signaling pathways through which an alkyphenol mixture triggers testicular cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Proliferation assays were monitored after exposure to a realistic mixture of 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol of either TCam-2 seminoma derived cells, NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cells or testis tumor in xenografted nude mice. Specific pharmacological inhibitors and gene-silencing strategies were used in TCam-2 cells in order to demonstrate that the alkylphenol mix triggers CREB-phosphorylation through a rapid, ER\u03b136-PI3kinase non genomic pathway. Microarray analysis of the mixture target genes revealed that this pathway can modulate the expression of the DNA-methyltransferase-3 (Dnmt3) gene family which is involved in DNA methylation control. Our results highlight a key role for ER\u03b136 in alkylphenol non genomic signaling in testicular germ cell tumors. Hence, ER\u03b136-dependent control of the epigenetic status opens the way for the understanding of the link between endocrine disruptor exposure and the burden of hormone sensitive cancers.", "meta": {"pmid": 23626723}}
{"text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are \u223c21-nucleotide-long, single-stranded noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Biogenesis of miRNAs is mediated by the two RNase III-like enzymes, Drosha and Dicer. Here we study miRNA biogenesis during maturation of Xenopus oocytes to eggs using microinjection of pri-miRNAs. We show that processing of exogenous and endogenous primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) is strongly enhanced upon maturation of oocytes to eggs. Overexpression of cloned Xenopus Drosha in oocytes, however, boosts pri-miRNA processing dramatically, indicating that Drosha is a rate-limiting factor in Xenopus oocytes. This developmental regulation of Drosha is controlled by poly(A) length addition to the Drosha mRNA, which boosts translation upon transition from oocytes to eggs. Processing of pri-miRNAs by Drosha and Dicer has been shown to be affected by adenosine-to-inosine deamination-type RNA editing. Using activated Xenopus eggs for microinjection experiments, we demonstrate that RNA editing can reduce pri-miRNA processing in vivo.

A systematic examination of the suitability of endogenous reference genes for gene expression studies in endometrial cancer tissues is absent. The aims of this study were therefore to identify and evaluate from the thirty-two possible reference genes from a TaqMan(\u00ae) array panel their suitability as an internal control gene. The mathematical software packages geNorm qBasePLUS identified Pumilio homolog 1 (Drosophila) (PUM1), ubiquitin C (UBC), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (MRPL19) and peptidylpropyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A) (PPIA) as the best reference gene combination, whilst NormFinder identified MRPL19 as the best single reference gene, with importin 8 (IPO8) and PPIA being the best combination of two reference genes. BestKeeper ranked MRPL19 as the most stably expressed gene. In addition, the study was validated by examining the relative expression of a test gene, which encodes the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). A significant difference in CB1 mRNA expression between malignant and normal endometrium using MRPL19, PPIA, and IP08 in combination was observed. The use of MRPL19, IPO8 and PPIA was identified as the best reference gene combination for the normalization of gene expression levels in endometrial carcinoma. This study demonstrates that the arbitrary selection of endogenous control reference genes for normalization in qRT-PCR studies of endometrial carcinoma, without validation, risks the production of inaccurate data and should therefore be discouraged.

{"text": "Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is routinely used immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation is commonly associated with several gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Here we present a case of giant gastric ulcer of 5 cm from MMF use post cardiac transplant. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old male with history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy post heart transplant was on immunosuppression with MMF, tacrolimus and prednisone for 5 months. He presented with severe epigastric pain and intermittent episodes of melena for 1 month. His pain radiated to back that is worsened with eating. Associated with loss of appetite, vomiting and 16-pound weight loss in 3 months. He never smoked, drank alcohol or used over the counter pain medications. He was profoundly anemic requiring blood transfusions. EGD performed demonstrated very large clean-based ulcer of 5 cm diameter in the body, smaller ulcer of 8 mm diameter in pre-pyloric region and 5-10 small aphthous ulcers in the gastric body and fundus. Gastric biopsies taken from the ulcer were negative for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus and malignancy. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed non-bleeding inflamed internal hemorrhoids. Consequently, MMF was discontinued and switched to azathioprine. He was treated with twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy with resolution of abdominal pain, improved appetite and weight gain. DISCUSSION: MMF is well known for common GI side-effects such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, ulcers, abdominal pain and rarely gastrointestinal bleeding. Few studies reported 3 to 8% incidence of ulcer perforation and GI bleeding within 6 months. Risk of gastroduodenal erosions is nearly 1.83 times for MMF, with the highest lesions associated with MMF-tacrolimus-corticosteroid combination treatment as seen in our patient. Hypothesis is that GI tract is vulnerable because of dependence of enterocytes on de novo synthesis of purines, which is disrupted by MMF. Typically, upper GI mucosal injuries of mucosal irritation leading to esophagitis, gastritis and/or ulcers are seen. Endoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic if bleeding gastric ulcers are noted. Minor complications improve with reduction of drug dose or use of enteric coated preparation if feasible. Discontinuation of the drug is main stay in the management of MMF related ulcer disease. Simple medical treatment with either H2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, coating agents, prostaglandins or combination has proven effective in most cases. Considering excellent results with medical management of ulcer, role of surgery is limited.", "meta": {"pmid": 32875528}}
{"text": "Centrioles are found in the centrosome core and, as basal bodies, at the base of cilia and flagella. Centriole assembly and duplication is controlled by Polo-like-kinase 4 (Plk4): these processes fail if Plk4 is downregulated and are promoted by Plk4 overexpression. Here we show that the centriolar protein Asterless (Asl; human orthologue CEP152) provides a conserved molecular platform, the amino terminus of which interacts with the cryptic Polo box of Plk4 whereas the carboxy terminus interacts with the centriolar protein Sas-4 (CPAP in humans). Drosophila Asl and human CEP152 are required for the centrosomal loading of Plk4 in Drosophila and CPAP in human cells, respectively. Depletion of Asl or CEP152 caused failure of centrosome duplication; their overexpression led to de novo centriole formation in Drosophila eggs, duplication of free centrosomes in Drosophila embryos, and centrosome amplification in cultured Drosophila and human cells. Overexpression of a Plk4-binding-deficient mutant of Asl prevented centriole duplication in cultured cells and embryos. However, this mutant protein was able to promote microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) formation in both embryos and oocytes. Such MTOCs had pericentriolar material and the centriolar protein Sas-4, but no centrioles at their core. Formation of such acentriolar MTOCs could be phenocopied by overexpression of Sas-4 in oocytes or embryos. Our findings identify independent functions for Asl as a scaffold for Plk4 and Sas-4 that facilitates self-assembly and duplication of the centriole and organization of pericentriolar material.", "meta": {"pmid": 20852615}}
{"text": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) promotes mRNA recruitment to the ribosome by binding to the mRNA cap- and poly(A) tail-binding proteins eIF4E and Pap1p. eIF4G also binds eIF4A at a distinct HEAT domain composed of five stacks of antiparallel alpha-helices. The role of eIF4G in the later steps of initiation, such as scanning and AUG recognition, has not been defined. Here we show that the entire HEAT domain and flanking residues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF4G2 are required for the optimal interaction with the AUG recognition factors eIF5 and eIF1. eIF1 binds simultaneously to eIF4G and eIF3c in vitro, as shown previously for the C-terminal domain of eIF5. In vivo, co-overexpression of eIF1 or eIF5 reverses the genetic suppression of an eIF4G HEAT domain Ts(-) mutation by eIF4A overexpression. In addition, excess eIF1 inhibits growth of a second eIF4G mutant defective in eIF4E binding, which was also reversed by co-overexpression of eIF4A. Interestingly, excess eIF1 carrying the sui1-1 mutation, known to relax the accuracy of start site selection, did not inhibit the growth of the eIF4G mutant, and sui1-1 reduced the interaction between eIF4G and eIF1 in vitro. Moreover, a HEAT domain mutation altering eIF4G moderately enhances translation from a non-AUG codon. These results strongly suggest that the binding of the eIF4G HEAT domain to eIF1 and eIF5 is important for maintaining the integrity of the scanning ribosomal preinitiation complex.", "meta": {"pmid": 12861028}}

Besides validating the fact that imputation accuracy could always benefit from the increased panel size when the reference panel was population specific, the results brought two new thoughts. First, when the haplotype size of the reference panel was fixed, the imputation accuracy of common and low-frequency variants (Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)\u2009>\u20090.5%) decreased while the population diversity of the reference panel increased, but for rare variants (MAF\u2009<\u20090.5%), a small fraction of diversity in panel could improve imputation accuracy. Second, when the haplotype size of the reference panel was increased with extra population-diverse samples, the imputation accuracy of common variants (MAF\u2009>\u20095%) for the European population could always benefit from the expanding sample size. However, for the Han Chinese population, the accuracy of all imputed variants reached the highest when reference panel contained a fraction of an extra diverse sample (8-21%). In addition, we evaluated the imputation performances in the existing reference panels, such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC), 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 and the China, Oxford and Virginia Commonwealth University Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology (CONVERGE). For the European population, the HRC panel showed the best performance in our analysis. For the Han Chinese population, we proposed an optimum imputation reference panel constituent ratio if researchers would like to customize their own sequenced reference panel, but a high-quality and large-scale Chinese reference panel was still needed.

{"text": "In humans, the polygenic growth hormone (GH) locus is located on chromosome 17 and contributes with three types of proteins: pituitary GH which consists of at least two isoforms one of 22\u202fkDa and the other of 20\u202fkDa, placental GH, which also exhibits isoforms, and chorionic somatomammotropin hormone (CSH). While pituitary GH results from the expression of the GH-1 (GH-N) gene, placental GH is produced by the expression of the GH-2 (GH-V) gene and CSH is contributed by expression of the CSH-1 and CSH-2 genes. The location where GH-1 is expressed is the anterior pituitary and the rest of the genes in the locus are expressed in placenta. On the other hand, expression and synthesis of GH in extra-pituitary tissues, including the eye, has been recently described. However, the physiological role of GH in the eye has not yet been elucidated, although a possible neuroprotective role has been hypothesized. Thus, we analyzed GH-1, GH-2, CSH1/2, Pit-1, GHR, GHRH, GHRHR, SST, SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR3, SSTR4, and SSTR5 to elucidate the expression and regulation of the GH locus in the human eye. Through qPCR analysis, we only found evidence of GH-1 expression in retina, choroid and trabecular meshwork; its transcript turned out to be the same as pituitary GH mRNA found in major species, and no splicing variants were detected. PIT1 was absent in all the ocular tissues implying an independent GH-1 expression mechanism. We found evidence of GHR in the cornea, choroid coat and retina. These results suggest autocrine and/or paracrine regulation, possibly exerted by GHRH and SSTs (since their mRNAs and receptors were found predominantly in retinal, choroidal and corneal tissues) since expression of both molecules was detected in different ocular tissues, as well as in the same tissues where GH-1 expression was confirmed.

In contrast, S. Typhimurium 14028 infection or co-culture with VIP had no effect on IL-10 receptor expression on the monocyte surface. However, S. Typhimurium 14028 down regulated IFNGR1 gene expression and this was not altered by co-culture with VIP, suggesting that changes in IFN\u03b3R1 protein may be due to an effect on cytoplasmic transport. 15 JAK/STAT genes, out of 84 studied, were up-regulated by S. Typhimurium 14028 infection and five were down-regulated. Co-culture with VIP significantly decreased expression of two genes (IFNG and IL-20) and increased expression of three genes (SOCS1, SOCS3 and STAT4) (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). S. Typhimurium 14028 also increased expression of PTPN1, which dephosphorylates JAK2 and TYK2. This was unaltered by co-culture with VIP but S.

{"text": "Amacrine interneurons that modulate synaptic plasticity between bipolar and ganglion cells constitute the most diverse cell type in the retina. Most are inhibitory neurons using either GABA or glycine as neurotransmitters. Although several transcription factors involved in amacrine cell fate determination have been identified, mechanisms underlying amacrine cell subtype specification remain to be further understood. The Prdm13 histone methyltransferase encoding gene is a target of the transcription factor Ptf1a, an essential regulator of inhibitory neuron cell fate in the retina. Here, we have deepened our knowledge on its interaction with Ptf1a and investigated its role in amacrine cell subtype determination in the developing Xenopus retina. We performed prdm13 gain and loss of function in Xenopus and assessed the impact on retinal cell fate determination using RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. We found that prdm13 in the amphibian Xenopus is expressed in few retinal progenitors and in about 40% of mature amacrine cells, predominantly in glycinergic ones. Clonal analysis in the retina reveals that prdm13 overexpression favours amacrine cell fate determination, with a bias towards glycinergic cells. Conversely, knockdown of prdm13 specifically inhibits glycinergic amacrine cell genesis. We also showed that, as in the neural tube, prdm13 is subjected to a negative autoregulation in the retina. Our data suggest that this is likely due to its ability to repress the expression of its inducer, ptf1a. Our results demonstrate that Prdm13, downstream of Ptf1a, acts as an important regulator of glycinergic amacrine subtype specification in the Xenopus retina. We also reveal that Prdm13 regulates ptf1a expression through a negative feedback loop.", "meta": {"pmid": 28863786}}

The study comprised 118 infants with respiratory failure, clinical and/or laboratory signs of acute inflammatory disease, and GBS infection proven by culture results. They were recruited retrospectively from a database of patients treated with surfactant at 28 neonatology units participating in European multicenter trials (1987-1993) and prospectively from the same units in the following years. A nonrandomized control group of 236 noninfected infants was selected from the same database. The primary parameters evaluated were oxygen requirement, ventilator settings, and incidence of complications. Median birth weight in the GBS study group was 1468 g (25th-75th percentiles: 1015-2170), and median gestational age was 30 (27-33) weeks. Thirty-one percent of the infants weighed >2000 g. Median age at surfactant treatment was 6 hours. The mean initial surfactant dose was 142 mg/kg (standard deviation: 53). Ninety of the infants were treated with Curosurf (Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy), 13 with Survanta (Abboth GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany), 12 with Alveofact (Dr Karl Thomae GmbH, Biberach, Germany), and 3 with Exosurf (Wellcome GmbH, Burgwedel, Germany).

Iron modulated APP holoprotein expression by a pathway similar to iron control of the translation of the ferritin-L and -H mRNAs by iron-responsive elements in their 5'-UTRs. APP gene transcription is also responsive to copper deficit where the Menkes protein depleted fibroblasts of copper to suppress transcription of APP through metal regulatory and copper regulatory sequences upstream of the APP 5' cap site. APP is a copper-zinc metalloprotein and chelation of Fe(3+) by desferrioxamine and Cu(2+) by clioquinol appeared to provide effective therapy for the treatment of AD in limited patient studies. We have introduced an RNA-based screen for small APP 5'-UTR binding molecules to identify leads that limit APP translation (but not APLP-1 and APLP-2) and amyloid Abeta peptide production. A library of 1200 drugs was screened to identify lead drugs that limited APP 5'-UTR-directed translation of a reporter gene. The efficacy of these leads was confirmed for specificity in a cell-based secondary assay to measure the steady-state levels of APP holoprotein relative to APLP-1/APLP-2 by Western blotting. Several chelators were identified among the APP 5'-UTR directed leads consistent with the presence of an IRE stem-loop in front of the start codon of the APP transcript. The APP 5'-UTR-directed drugs--desferrioxamine (Fe(3+) chelator), tetrathiomolybdate (Cu(2+) chelator), and dimercaptopropanol (Pb(2+) and Hg(2+) chelator)--each suppressed APP holoprotein expression (and lowered Abeta peptide secretion). The novel anticholinesterase phenserine also provided \"proof of concept\" for our strategy to target the APP 5'-UTR sequence to identify \"anti-amyloid\" drugs. We further defined the interaction between iron chelation and phenserine action to control APP 5'-UTR-directed translation in neuroblastoma (SY5Y) transfectants.

An experiment was conducted on transition cows to evaluate the expression of key endocannabinoid genes in bovine endometrium in response to dietary supplementation with CLA.

Results reported that relative levels of mRNA encoding CNR2 and NAPEPLD were decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared with control cows between Days 21 and 42 postpartum.

Patients less than 18 years old with sepsis from extrapulmonary infection with (n = 46) or without (n = 54) acute respiratory distress syndrome and noninfected controls (n = 19). None. Endothelial (angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like loop epidermal growth factor homology domain 2, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase, von Willebrand factor, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule, thrombomodulin) and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8) were measured from peripheral plasma collected within 3 days (time 1) of sepsis recognition and at 3-6 days (time 2) and 7-14 days (time 3).

{"text": "The nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) is a novel pro-drug of tenofovir (TFV) and possesses a superior renal safety profile compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF). Due to unique pharmacokinetic characteristics, treatment with TAF is not associated with significant renal proximal tubular accumulation of TFV. TAF is associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria and renal proximal tubular dysfunction than treatment with TDF. No cases of Fanconi syndrome have been reported in clinical trials of TAF. It is unknown whether treatment with TAF can lead to accumulation of TFV in proximal tubular cells and cause nephrotoxicity under certain clinical circumstances. Here we report the case of a patient on stable TAF-based antiretroviral therapy with for HIV-1 infection who developed proximal tubulopathy when treated with gentamicin for febrile neutropenia in the context of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Eighteen days after commencing chemotherapy for relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma the patient presented to hospital with fevers, hypotension and neutropenia. The patient was commenced on piperacillin, tazobactam and gentamicin. Within 24\u2009h the patient developed marked hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia requiring intravenous replacement therapy. There was proteinuria, glycosuria and evidence of marked urinary electrolyte wasting, consistent with acute proximal tubular dysfunction. Eleven days after the gentamicin was stopped the serum biochemistry normalised. The urinary electrolyte wasting and proteinuria had improved, and the glycosuria had resolved. This is the first case report to describe acute renal proximal tubulopathy in an HIV-infected patient treated with TAF and gentamicin. As the number of patients prescribed TAF outside the clinical trial setting increases, so too does the potential for previously unreported drug interactions and adverse events. Clinicians need to be aware of potential unreported adverse drug reactions as the use of TAF becomes increasingly common in clinical practice.", "meta": {"pmid": 32787843}}
{"text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaque in the brain. The autophagy-associated PIK3C3-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex has been shown to interfere with APP metabolism and amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2) homeostasis via poorly understood mechanisms. Here we report that NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2), a key component and regulator of the PtdIns3K, is involved in APP-CTFs homeostasis in AD cell models. We found that NRBF2 interacts with APP in vivo and its expression levels are reduced in hippocampus of 5XFAD AD mice; we further demonstrated that NRBF2 overexpression promotes degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), and reduces A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 levels in human mutant APP-overexpressing cells. Conversely, APP-CTFs, A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 levels were increased in Nrbf2 knockdown or nrbf2 knockout cells. Furthermore, NRBF2 positively regulates autophagy in neuronal cells and NRBF2-mediated reduction of APP-CTFs levels is autophagy dependent. Importantly, nrbf2 knockout attenuates the recruitment of APP and APP-CTFs into phagophores and the sorting of APP and APP-CTFs into endosomal intralumenal vesicles, which is accompanied by the accumulation of the APP and APP-CTFs into RAB5-positive early endosomes. Collectively, our results reveal the potential connection between NRBF2 and the AD-associated protein APP by showing that NRBF2 plays an important role in regulating degradation of APP-CTFs through modulating autophagy.", "meta": {"pmid": 28980867}}
{"text": "Interactions among the forebrain, neural crest and facial ectoderm regulate development of the upper jaw. To examine these interactions, we activated the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway in the brain. Beginning 72 hours after activation of the SHH pathway, growth within the avian frontonasal process (FNP) was exaggerated in lateral regions and impaired in medial regions. This growth pattern is similar to that in mice and superimposed a mammalian-like morphology on the upper jaw. Jaw growth is controlled by signals from the frontonasal ectodermal zone (FEZ), and the divergent morphologies that characterize birds and mammals are accompanied by changes in the FEZ. In chicks there is a single FEZ spanning the FNP, but in mice both median nasal processes have a FEZ. In treated chicks, the FEZ was split into right and left domains that resembled the pattern present in mice. Additionally, we observed that, in the brain, fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) was downregulated, and signals in or near the nasal pit were altered. Raldh2 expression was expanded, whereas Fgf8, Wnt4, Wnt6 and Zfhx1b were downregulated. However, Wnt9b, and activation of the canonical WNT pathway, were unaltered in treated embryos. At later time points the upper beak was shortened owing to hypoplasia of the skeleton, and this phenotype was reproduced when we blocked the FGF pathway. Thus, the brain establishes multiple signaling centers within the developing upper jaw. Changes in organization of the brain that occur during evolution or as a result of disease can alter these centers and thereby generate morphological variation.", "meta": {"pmid": 19036802}}

{"text": "Tumor suppressor protein p53 is a positive regulator of MDM2 gene expression and the mdm2 protein can bind to p53, preventing the transactivation of p53 responsive genes, thus mimicking TP53 mutation. The authors looked for alterations that could affect, directly and indirectly, p53 function in 13 patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Molecular analysis by single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing revealed that TP53 gene mutations occurred in only 2 of 13 cholangiocarcinomas. High levels of mdm2 protein were found, by immunohistochemical staining, in 61% of the cholangiocarcinomas and in almost all specimens (70%) displaying stabilized p53 protein in the absence and in the presence of TP53 mutations. The finding of co-overexpressed mdm2 and p53 proteins in cholangiocarcinomas indicates that they can upregulate the expression of mdm2 protein to a level sufficient for binding and accumulating p53 in a presumably inactive complexed form. The presence of TP53 mutations or upregulation of MDM2 gene expression in 9 of the 13 cholangiocarcinomas strongly supports that the impairment of the p53 pathway is an important and specific step in cholangiocarcinoma pathogenesis. At variance with other authors, no alteration of p16ink4/CDKN2 gene was observed in all 13 cholangiocarcinomas.", "meta": {"pmid": 10718212}}
{"text": "The incidences of chronic inflammatory disorders have increased considerably over the past three decades. Recent shifts in dietary consumption may have contributed importantly to this surge, but how dietary consumption modulates inflammatory disease is poorly defined. Pstpip2(cmo) mice, which express a homozygous Leu98Pro missense mutation in the Pombe Cdc15 homology family protein PSTPIP2 (proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 2), spontaneously develop osteomyelitis that resembles chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis in humans. Recent reports demonstrated a crucial role for interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in osteomyelitis, but deletion of the inflammasome components caspase-1 and NLRP3 failed to rescue Pstpip2(cmo) mice from inflammatory bone disease. Thus, the upstream mechanisms controlling IL-1\u03b2 production in Pstpip2(cmo) mice remain to be identified. In addition, the environmental factors driving IL-1\u03b2-dependent inflammatory bone erosion are unknown. Here we show that the intestinal microbiota of diseased Pstpip2(cmo) mice was characterized by an outgrowth of Prevotella. Notably, Pstpip2(cmo) mice that were fed a diet rich in fat and cholesterol maintained a normal body weight, but were markedly protected against inflammatory bone disease and bone erosion. Diet-induced protection against osteomyelitis was accompanied by marked reductions in intestinal Prevotella levels and significantly reduced pro-IL-1\u03b2 expression in distant neutrophils. Furthermore, pro-IL-1\u03b2 expression was also decreased in Pstpip2(cmo) mice treated with antibiotics, and in wild-type mice that were kept under germ-free conditions. We further demonstrate that combined deletion of caspases 1 and 8 was required for protection against IL-1\u03b2-dependent inflammatory bone disease, whereas the deletion of either caspase alone or of elastase or neutrophil proteinase 3 failed to prevent inflammatory disease. Collectively, this work reveals diet-associated changes in the intestinal microbiome as a crucial factor regulating inflammasome- and caspase-8-mediated maturation of IL-1\u03b2 and osteomyelitis in Pstpip2(cmo) mice.", "meta": {"pmid": 25274309}}
{"text": "In addition to the apical-basal polarity pathway operating in epithelial cells, a planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway establishes polarity within the plane of epithelial tissues and is conserved from Drosophila to mammals.

In vertebrates, the PCP pathway regulates convergent extension movements and neural tube closure, as well as the orientation of stereociliary bundles of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Here we show that a mutation in the mouse protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) gene, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein with tyrosine kinase homology, disrupts neural tube closure and stereociliary bundle orientation, and shows genetic interactions with a mutation in the mouse Van Gogh homologue vangl2.

{"text": "During B-cell development, immature B-cell fate is determined by whether the BCR is engaged in the bone marrow. Immature B cells that are non-autoreactive continue maturation and emigrate from the marrow, whereas autoreactive immature B cells remain and are tolerized. However, the microenvironment where these events occur and the chemoattractants responsible for immature B-cell trafficking within and out of the bone marrow remain largely undefined. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a chemoattractant that directs lymphocyte trafficking and thymocyte egress and in this study we investigated whether S1P contributes to B-cell development, egress and positioning within the bone marrow. Our findings show that immature B cells are chemotactic toward S1P but that this response is dependent on Ag receptor specificity: non-autoreactive, but not autoreactive, immature B cells migrate toward S1P and are shown to require S1P3 receptor for this response. Despite this response, S1P3 is shown not to facilitate immature B-cell egress but is required for normal B-cell development including the positioning of transitional B cells within bone marrow sinusoids. These data indicate that S1P3 signaling directs immature B cells to a bone marrow microenvironment important for both tolerance induction and maturation.", "meta": {"pmid": 20039302}}

Different bile acid conjugated tS-ODN complementary to the HCV5'NCR were selected for their inhibitory potential in an in vitro transcription/translation assay. To analyze OATP (organic anion transporting polypeptides)-selective uptake of bile acid conjugated ODN, different hepatoma cells were stably transfected with the OATP1B1-transporter and primary human hepatocytes were used. An adenovirus encoding the HCV5'NCR fused to the luciferase gene (Ad-GFP-NCRluc) was generated to quantify 5'NCR-dependent HCV gene expression in OATP-overexpressing hepatoma cells and in vivo. A 17mer phosphorothioate modified ODN (tS-ODN4_13) complementary to HCV5'NCR was able to inhibit 5'NCR-dependent HCV-translation in an in vitro transcription/translation test system by more than 90% and it was also effective in Huh7-cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon. Conjugation to taurocholate (tS-ODN4_13T) significantly increased selective ODN uptake by primary human hepatocytes and by OATP1B1-expressing HepG2-cells compared to parental HepG2-cells. Correspondingly, tS-ODN4_13T significantly inhibited HCV gene expression in liver-derived OATP1B1-expressing HepG2- or CCL13-cells up to 70% compared to unconjugated tS-ODN and compared to mismatch taurocholate coupled tS-ODN.

The tested taurocholate conjugated 17mer antisense ODN complementary to HCV5'NCV showed an increased and selective uptake by hepatocytes and liver-derived cells through OATP-mediated transport resulting in enhanced specific inhibition of HCV gene expression in vitro and in vivo.

The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of protein phosphatases (PPs) in estrogen neuroprotection against oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. HT-22 cells, C6-glioma cells, and primary rat cortical neurons were exposed to the nonspecific serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A at various concentrations in the presence or absence of 17beta-estradiol and/or glutamate. Okadaic acid and calyculin A caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in HT-22, C6-glioma, and primary rat cortical neurons. 17beta-Estradiol did not show protection against neurotoxic concentrations of either okadaic acid or calyculin A in these cells. In the absence of these serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors, 17beta-estradiol attenuated glutamate toxicity. However, in the presence of effective concentrations of these protein phosphatase inhibitors, 17beta-estradiol protection against glutamate toxicity was lost. Furthermore, glutamate treatment in HT-22 cells and primary rat cortical neurons caused a 50% decrease in levels of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B protein, whereas coadministration of 17beta-estradiol with glutamate prevented the decrease in PP1, PP2A, and PP2B levels. These results suggest that 17beta-estradiol may protect cells against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and excitotoxicity by activating a combination of protein phosphatases.", "meta": {"pmid": 16079401}}

The condition is considered to cause a \"pure\" muscle phenotype with symptoms including exercise intolerance, inability to perform isometric activities, contracture, and acute rhabdomyolysis leading to acute renal failure. This is a retrospective observational study aiming to describe phenotypic and genotypic features of a large cohort of patients with McArdle disease between 2011 and 2019. Data relating to genotype and phenotype, including frequency of rhabdomyolysis, fixed muscle weakness, gout and comorbidities, inclusive of retinal disease (pattern retinal dystrophy) and thyroid disease, were collected. Data from 197 patients are presented. Seven previously unpublished PYGM mutations are described. Exercise intolerance (100%) and episodic rhabdomyolysis (75.6%) were the most common symptoms. Fixed muscle weakness was present in 82 (41.6%) subjects. Unexpectedly, ptosis was observed in 28 patients (14.2%). Hyperuricaemia was a common finding present in 88 subjects (44.7%), complicated by gout in 25% of cases. Thyroid dysfunction was described in 30 subjects (15.2%), and in 3 cases, papillary thyroid cancer was observed. Pattern retinal dystrophy was detected in 15 out of the 41 subjects that underwent an ophthalmic assessment (36.6%). In addition to fixed muscle weakness, ptosis was a relatively common finding. Surprisingly, dysfunction of thyroid and retinal abnormalities were relatively frequent comorbidities. Further studies are needed to better clarify this association, although our finding may have important implication for patient management.", "meta": {"pmid": 34534370}}
{"text": "Dietary fibres are indigestible food ingredients that reach the colon and are then fermented by colonic bacteria, resulting mainly in the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Those SCFA, especially butyrate, are recognised for their potential to act on secondary chemoprevention by slowing growth and activating apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Additionally, SCFA can also act on primary prevention by activation of different drug metabolising enzymes. This can reduce the burden of carcinogens and, therefore, decrease the number of mutations, reducing cancer risk. Activation of GSTs by butyrate has been studied on mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity level by real-time RT-PCR, cDNA microarrays, Western blotting, or photometrical approaches, respectively. Butyrate had differential effects in colon cells of different stages of cancer development. In HT29 tumour cells, e.g., mRNA GSTA4, GSTP1, GSTM2, and GSTT2 were induced. In LT97 adenoma cells, GSTM3, GSTT2, and MGST3 were induced, whereas GSTA2, GSTT2, and catalase (CAT) were elevated in primary colon cells. Colon cells of different stages of carcinogenesis differed in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms because butyrate increased protein levels of different GST isoforms and total GST enzyme activity in HT29 cells, whereas in LT97 cells, GST protein levels and activity were slightly reduced. Because butyrate increased histone acetylation and phosphorylation of ERK in HT29 cells, inhibition of histone deacetylases and the influence on MAPK signalling are possible mechanisms of GST activation by butyrate. Functional consequences of this activation include a reduction of DNA damage caused by carcinogens like hydrogen peroxide or 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in butyrate-treated colon cells. Treatment of colon cells with the supernatant from an in vitro fermentation of inulin increased GST activity and decreased HNE-induced DNA damage in HT29 cells. Additional animal and human studies are needed to define the exact role of dietary fibre and butyrate in inducing GST activity and reducing the risk of colon cancer.", "meta": {"pmid": 19383551}}
{"text": "Nude mice bearing the human oral cavity carcinoma cell line OCC-1, and the lung cancer cell line LC-1, developed a triple paraneoplastic syndrome consisting of hypercalcemia, cachexia and leukocytosis. All of these abnormalities disappeared rapidly after surgical resection of the tumors, suggesting their ectopic humoral nature. Search for the factors responsible for the respective abnormalities revealed that the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), mainly granulocyte-CSF, by the tumors could explain the hypercalcemia and leukocytosis, respectively. With regard to the severe cachexia, the production of two cachexia-associated cytokines, interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, was able to explain the syndrome in OCC-1 bearing nude mice; however, the factor responsible in LC-1 bearing nude mice could not be identified. The triple paraneoplastic syndrome that developed in these two animal models could be explained partly by concomitant production of the peptide hormone and cytokines by cancer cells. These animal models may be very useful for the evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for humoral abnormalities.", "meta": {"pmid": 8609700}}
{"text": "Aberrant DNA methylation is a common phenomenon in human cancer. The aims of this study were to investigate the methylation profiles of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the Chinese population. Twenty tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) were determined of the methylation status using methylation-specific PCR in 78 paired NSCLC specimens and adjacent normal tissues, as well as in 110 Stage I/II NSCLC and 50 cancer-free plasmas. The results showed that, nine genes (APC, CDH13, KLK10, DLEC1, RASSF1A, EFEMP1, SFRP1, RAR\u03b2 and p16(INK4A)) demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of methylation in NSCLC compared with the normal tissues (P\u22640.001), while the others (RUNX3, hMLH1, DAPK, BRCA1, p14(ARF), MGMT, NORE1A, FHIT, CMTM3, LSAMP and OPCML) showed relatively low sensitivity or specificity. Furthermore, methylation of multiple genes was more frequentin cancerous tissue, CpG island methylator phenotype positive (CIMP+) cases were detected in 65.38% of (51/78) NSCLC while only in 1.28% (1/78) of adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001), and CIMP+ was associated with advanced stage (P=0.017), lymphatic metastasis (P=0.001) and adverse 2-year progression-free survival (P=0.027). The nine genes validated in tissues also showed a significantly higher frequency of tumor-specific hypermethylation in NSCLC plasma, as compared with the cancer-free plasmas, and a 5-gene set (APC, RASSF1A, CDH13, KLK10 and DLEC1) achieved a sensitivity of 83.64% and a specificity of 74.0% for cancer diagnosis. Thus, the results indicated that methylated alteration of multiple genes plays an important role in NSCLC pathogenesis and a panel of candidate epigenetic biomarkers for NSCLC detection in the Chinese population was identified.", "meta": {"pmid": 21255913}}

{"text": "The Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases, ROCK1 and ROCK2, are important regulators of cell shape, migration, and proliferation through effects on the actin cytoskeleton. However, it is not known whether ROCK2 plays an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To determine whether the loss of ROCK2 could prevent cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte-specific ROCK2-null (c-ROCK2(-/-)) were generated using conditional ROCK2(flox/flox) mice and \u03b1-myosin heavy-chain promoter-driven Cre recombinase transgenic mice. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by Ang II infusion (400 ng/kg/min, 28 d) or transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Under basal conditions, hemodynamic parameters, cardiac anatomy, and function of c-ROCK2(-/-) mice were comparable to wild-type (WT) mice. However, following Ang II infusion or TAC, c-ROCK2(-/-) mice exhibited a substantially smaller increase in heart-to-body weight ratio, left ventricular mass, myocyte cross-sectional area, hypertrophy-related fetal gene expression, intraventricular fibrosis, cardiac apoptosis, and oxidative stress compared to control mice. Deletion of ROCK2 in cardiomyocytes leads to increased expression of four-and-a-half LIM-only protein-2 (FHL2) and FHL2-mediated inhibition of serum response factor (SRF) and extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK). Knockdown of FHL2 expression in ROCK2-deficient cardiomyocytes or placing ROCK2-haploinsufficient (ROCK2(+/-)) mice on FHL2(+/-)-haploinsufficient background restored the hypertrophic response to Ang II. These results indicate that cardiomyocyte ROCK2 is essential for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and that up-regulation of FHL2 may contribute to the antihypertrophic phenotype that is observed in cardiac-specific ROCK2-deficient mice.", "meta": {"pmid": 23271052}}

{"text": "Transplantation of a murine mammary carcinoma (CE maca) into mice induces marked granulocytosis and hypercalcemia secondary to excessive bone resorption. Such responses are not induced by another murine mammary carcinoma Bc66. In order to understand the mechanisms of these unique phenomena, we analyzed mRNA of tumor cells for expression of murine granulopoietic growth factors and studied interactions of tumor-derived factors using antiserum to a growth factor in vitro and in vivo. The Northern blot analysis of CE tumor clones revealed the expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), but no other CSF genes, while the Bc66 clone expressed only M-CSF. The G-CSF and M-CSF gene expression in CE tumor clones was accompanied by secretion of these proteins in culture. The granulocyte stimulating activity of CE tumor-derived G-CSF or recombinant human G-CSF was markedly enhanced by purified M-CSF in vitro. Significant but variable neutrophilia was observed in mice inoculated with CE tumor clones. Anti-M-CSF treatment of CE tumor-bearing mice significantly reduced neutrophilia, but did not affect hypercalcemia. These studies document that G-CSF and M-CSF are produced constitutively from the CE maca, and G-CSF is likely responsible for granulocytosis induced by this tumor. G-CSF and M-CSF function synergistically in granulocyte stimulation in vitro and this synergism may also play a role in marked granulocytosis of tumor-bearing animals, providing further evidence of the effect of CSFs in vivo.", "meta": {"pmid": 2473793}}
{"text": "The risk of the development of tendon disorders or ruptures increases with age, but it is unclear whether intrinsic fitness during lifetime might also affect tendon properties. To investigate this, a contrasting rat model of high-capacity runners (HCR with high intrinsic fitness) and low-capacity runners (LCR with low intrinsic fitness) was employed. Histological and molecular changes in rotator cuff (RC) tendons from 10 weeks old (young; HCR-10 and LCR-10) and 100 weeks old (old; HCR-100 and LCR-100) female rats were investigated. Age-dependent changes of RC tendons observed in HCR and LCR were increase of weight, decrease of tenocytes and RNA content, reduction of the wavy pattern of collagen and elastic fibers, repressed expression of Col1a1, Eln, Postn, Tnmd, Tgfb3 and Egr1 and reduction of the Col1:Col3 and Col1:Eln ratio. The LCR rats showed less physical activity, increased body weight, signs of metabolic disease and a reduced life expectancy. Their RC tendons revealed increased weight (more than age-dependent) and enlargement of the tenocyte nuclei (consistent with degenerative tendons). Low intrinsic fitness led to repressed expression of a further nine genes (Col3a1, Fbn1, Dcn, Tnc, Scx, Mkx, Bmp1, Tgfb1, Esr1) as well as the rise of the Col1:Col3 and Col1:Eln ratios (related to the lesser expression of Col3a1 and Eln). The intrinsic fitness influences the female RC tendons at least as much as age. Lower intrinsic fitness accelerates aging of RC tendons and leads to further impairment; this could result in decreased healing potential and elasticity and increased stiffness.", "meta": {"pmid": 35203717}}

We report on a 71-year-old postmenopausal woman who underwent in our department a L2-pelvis instrumented fusion for failed lumbar decompression and interbody fusion performed in another institution. For at least one year, the patient was receiving antiosteoporotic treatment (Alendronate plus Calcium and Vitamin D) and was fully ambulatory without limping. Eighteen months following our surgery, the patient sought again our department because of increasing pain in her right hip and limping without trauma. The physical examination disclosed painful passive motion in her right hip. The roentgenograms and CT-scans disclosed a transverse acetabular fracture with radiolucencies around both iliac screw tips, particularly the right. Additionally, a severe compression fracture of the 12th thoracic vertebral body and upper endplate of the L2 vertebra was disclosed. We recommended open stabilization of the acetabulum and T12 and L2 vertebrae. Immediately before the planned surgeries, the patient had a serious heart infarct, and thus, surgeries were canceled by the patient's cardiologist because of the high perioperative risk. The patient and relatives denied further surgeries because of the heart disease. In the final telephone call and CT and roentgenographic evaluation that went to us after request, there was an acetabular pseudarthrosis in the right hip without however associated complaints. Since surgery was not accepted, the patient was prescribed Denosumab injection therapy plus Vitamin and Calcium supplement. This case report emphasizes the significance of follow-up observation of elderly patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis following lumbopelvic fusions, for possible fatigue acetabular and vertebral fractures. The authors speculate that this extremely rare acetabular \"fatigue\"/insufficiency fracture should be the result of increased repetitive mechanical forces acting around the acetabulum in association with osteoporosis.", "meta": {"pmid": 34631186}}
{"text": "Ectopic acromegaly is a very rare clinical entity occurring in less than 1% of acromegalic patients. In most cases it is caused by GHRH or rarely GH-secreting neoplasms. Even rarer are ectopic pituitary adenomas located in the sphenoid sinus or nasopharynx that originate from pituitary remnants in the craniopharyngeal duct. This dissertation presents the difficulties in visualizing GH-secreting adenoma located in the sphenoid sinus. A 55-year-old man had somatic features of acromegaly for several years. MRI imaging revealed a slightly asymmetric pituitary gland (14 yen 4 mm) without focal lesions. Simultaneously, a spherical mass, 10 mm in diameter, corresponding with ectopic microadenoma was demonstrated on the upper wall of the sphenoid sinus. The serum GH level was 4.3 mg/l, IGF-1 = 615 mg/l, and a lack of GH suppression with oral glucose was proven. After preliminary treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analogue, transsphenoidal pituitary tumour removal was performed. Histopathological, electron microscopical and immunohistochemical analysis revealed densely granulated somatotropic pituitary adenoma: GH(+), PRL(-), ACTH(-), TSH(-), FSH(-), LH(-), MIB1 < 1%, SSTR3(+) and SSTR5(+). Post-surgical evaluation showed normal pituitary MRI scans, GH and IGF-1 levels 0.18 mug/l and 140 mg/l, respectively, as well as normal GH suppression with oral glucose.

The SRSF1 gene itself is amplified in some cancer cells, and cancer-associated changes in the expression of MYC also increase SRSF1 gene expression. Increased concentrations of SRSF1 protein promote prooncogenic splicing patterns of a number of key regulators of cell growth. Here, we review the evidence that upregulation of the SR-related Tra2 \u03b2 protein might have a similar role in cancer cells. The TRA2B gene encoding Tra2 \u03b2 is amplified in particular tumours including those of the lung, ovary, cervix, stomach, head, and neck. Both TRA2B RNA and Tra2 \u03b2 protein levels are upregulated in breast, cervical, ovarian, and colon cancer, and Tra2 \u03b2 expression is associated with cancer cell survival. The TRA2B gene is a transcriptional target of the protooncogene ETS-1 which might cause higher levels of expression in some cancer cells which express this transcription factor.

{"text": "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants are at present time the most useful for the treatment of depression. SSRIs exhibit differences in potency of inhibiting serotonin reuptake, although the differences do not correlate with clinical efficacy. There are substantial pharmacokinetic differences among the five SSRIs, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and citalopram. Optimum use of these drugs requires a working knowledge of these differences. Among these pharmacokinetic parameters, half-life and metabolism pathways are the most relevant. There are substantial differences in term of their half-life between fluoxetine and others SSRIs. The half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine is respectively 2 to 4 days and 7 to 15 days, more extended than other SSRIs (approximately 1 day). The extended half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite may be an advantage in the poorly compliant patient and may offer a potential safety advantage over shorter-acting SSRIs, with respect to abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Conversely, this long half-life needs a long period of wash-out (5 weeks) before introducing other drugs (MAOIs, sumatriptan) which can interact with serotonin function and can lead to the serotoninergic syndrome. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of the hepatic isoenzyme P450-2D6 and would be expected to have effects on the clearance of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor, followed by fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram and fluvoxamine. The metabolite elimination of citalopram, paroxetine and fluvoxamine is delayed by renal disease and dosages should be lowered in elderly patients. Conversely the pharmacokinetic of fluoxetine and sertraline are not affected by either age or renal impairment and, for fluoxetine, by obesity.", "meta": {"pmid": 10598311}}

We established a transformed mouse myeloma cell line, SPG14, which expresses recombinant human GAD65, a major isomer of 65 kDa, inside the cells. GAD65 was partially purified by affinity chromatography using the mouse anti-GAD antibody (Ab). We also established a sandwich ELISA for anti-GAD Ab of the IgG class using GAD65 for coating and the anti-human IgG for detection and examined 54 sera of the IDDM patients and 45 sera of normal individuals. When the mean +2 SD of the color development of the sera of normal individuals was used as a cut-off level, 59.2% of patients with IDDM were positive. This indicates that the ELISA was effective to differentiate IDDM and NIDDM. The result also indicates that the autoantibody to GAD does not dissociate from the recombinant GAD rapidly, even when unbound anti-GAD Ab was fully removed. By using a perfusion culture system, we obtained as many as 4.2 x 10(10) SPG14 cells, from which 5 mg of GAD65 could be obtained; this is sufficient for 5,000 assays.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the data about the efficacy and safety of NSAIDs obtained from the questionnaires submitted to the outpatients receiving these drugs. The patients who had been prescribed any of NSAIDs whithin the period from June to September, 2004 were included in the study. The answers obtained from the questionnaires were statistically analyzed by means of chi2-test. At the time of the study, 150 patients had been prescribed ibuprofen or some other NSAID. Out of the total number of dispensed questionnaires (n = 150), only 45 (30%) were shown to be correctly filled-in. Their analysis showed that 64.4% of the patients had suffered from rheumatic diseases for more than five years, and had regularly used NSAIDs. The average age of these patients was about 70 years, and the number of females was double as high as that of the males. The most frequently used NSAIDs were diclofenac and ibuprofen (46.14%, and 23.24%, respectively). According to the answers given by the patients, the most often adverse reactions were gastric complaints such as nausea (11.1%), and stomach pain (8.9%). Due to this, the majority of the patients (64.4%) used some of the antiulcer drugs, most often ranitidine (31.1%). The results of this pilot study revealed that among the outpatients suffering from rheumatic diseases, the number of females was double as high as the number of males, that these patients were of the mean age of 70 years, and that their diseases lasted longer than five years. Gastric complains such as nausea and gastric pain of mild intensity were the most often adverse effects of NSAIDs reported by our patients. It could be the consequence of the predominant use of diclofenac and ibuprofen, NSAIDs with mild to moderate ulcerogenic potential, as well as the concomitant use of H2-receptor antagonists.", "meta": {"pmid": 16605193}}

{"text": "The relaxin peptides are a family of hormones that share a structural fold characterized by two chains, A and B, that are cross-braced by three disulfide bonds. Relaxins signal through two different classes of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs LGR7 and LGR8 together with GPCR135 and GPCR142, now referred to as the relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors 1-4, respectively. Although key binding residues have been identified in the B-chain of the relaxin peptides, the role of the A-chain in their activity is currently unknown. A recent study showed that INSL3 can be truncated at the N terminus of its A-chain by up to 9 residues without affecting the binding affinity to its receptor RXFP2 while becoming a high affinity antagonist. This suggests that the N terminus of the INSL3 A-chain contains residues essential for RXFP2 activation. In this study, we have synthesized A-chain truncated human relaxin-2 and -3 (H2 and H3) relaxin peptides, characterized their structure by both CD and NMR spectroscopy, and tested their binding and cAMP activities on RXFP1, RXFP2, and RXFP3. In stark contrast to INSL3, A-chain-truncated H2 relaxin peptides lost RXFP1 and RXFP2 binding affinity and concurrently cAMP-stimulatory activity. H3 relaxin A-chain-truncated peptides displayed similar properties on RXFP1, highlighting a similar binding mechanism for H2 and H3 relaxin. In contrast, A-chain-truncated H3 relaxin peptides showed identical activity on RXFP3, highlighting that the B-chain is the sole determinant of the H3 relaxin-RXFP3 interaction.

Although GAPDH was upregulated neither in CRC nor IBD, it tended to positively correlate with tumor depth and Crohn's disease activity index. Normalizing against GAPDH affected experimental conclusions in a small but not large bowel. Bowel inflammation significantly affects several classic HKG.

Octreotide dose dependently inhibited thymidine incorporation (-57%) and GH secretion (-41%) from GC cells in culture. In vivo, 6 weeks after GC cell implantation, plasma GH, IGF-1 and insulin levels were highly elevated. Cluster analysis of GH secretory dynamics revealed that GH secretion was less pulsatile in GC-implanted than in control animals. Furthermore, in GC-implanted animals, passive immunization either with SRIH or GHRH antisera, did not affect GH plasma levels. Three weeks after GC cell implantation, when tumors became palpable, octreotide (1 micrograms/h/kg BW) or saline was infused constantly for three weeks by osmotic minipumps. In octreotide treated rats, GH, IGF-1 and insulin levels were not different from sham-implanted animals and tumors weight were reduced by 80%. High affinity somatostatin binding sites were found in equivalent amounts on tumors from octreotide-treated or saline-treated animals. These findings indicate that GH secretion in GC-rats is mainly derived from the tumors and independent of hypothalamic control and that octreotide reduces both GH secretion and tumor growth.

{"text": "Autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway that functions in protein and organelle turnover in response to starvation and cellular stress. Autophagy is initiated by the formation of a complex containing Beclin 1 (BECN1) and its binding partner Phosphoinositide-3-kinase, class 3 (PIK3C3). Recently, BECN1 deficiency was shown to enhance the pathology of a mouse model of Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, the mechanism by which BECN1 or autophagy mediate these effects are unknown. Here, we report that the levels of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its metabolites can be reduced through autophagy activation, indicating that they are a substrate for autophagy. Furthermore, we find that knockdown of Becn1 in cell culture increases the levels of APP and its metabolites. Accumulation of APP and APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTF) are accompanied by impaired autophagosomal clearance. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation causes a comparable accumulation of APP and APP-metabolites in autophagosomes. Becn1 reduction in cell culture leads to lower levels of its binding partner Pik3c3 and increased presence of Microtubule-associated protein 1, light chain 3 (LC3). Overexpression of Becn1, on the other hand, reduces cellular APP levels. In line with these observations, we detected less BECN1 and PIK3C3 but more LC3 protein in brains of AD patients. We conclude that BECN1 regulates APP processing and turnover. BECN1 is involved in autophagy initiation and autophagosome clearance. Accordingly, BECN1 deficiency disrupts cellular autophagy and autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation and alters APP metabolism. Together, our findings suggest that autophagy and the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex regulate APP processing and play an important role in AD pathology.", "meta": {"pmid": 20559548}}
{"text": "We previously demonstrated that FGD1, the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) responsible for faciogenital dysplasia, and its homologue FGD3 are targeted by the ubiquitin ligase SCF(FWD1) upon phosphorylation of two serine residues in their DSGIDS motif and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. FGD1 and FGD3 share highly homologous Dbl homology (DH) and adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, both of which are responsible for GEF activity. However, their function and regulation are remarkably different. Here we demonstrate extracellular signal-responsive translocation of FGD1, but not FGD3. During the wound-healing process, translocation of FGD1 to the leading edge membrane occurs in cells facing to the wound. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the membrane translocation of FGD1, but not FGD3. As the most striking difference, FGD3 lacks the N-terminal proline-rich domain that is conserved in FGD1, indicating that proline-rich domain may play a crucial role in signal-responsive translocation of FGD1. Indeed, there is a faciogenital dysplasia patient who has a missense mutation in proline-rich domain of FGD1, by which the serine residue at position 205 is substituted with isoleucine. When expressed in cells, the mutant FGD1 with S(205)/I substitution fails to translocate to the membrane in response to the mitogenic stimuli. Thus we present a novel mechanism by which the activity of FGD1, a GEF for Cdc42, is temporally and spatially regulated in cells.", "meta": {"pmid": 20045932}}

All the ecotoxicological tests were supported by chemical analyses to confirm the exposure concentrations of the pharmaceuticals used in the toxicity experiments, since deviations from the nominal concentration can result in underestimation of biological effects.

The tif5-7A mutation in eIF5-CTD, which destabilizes the multifactor complex in vivo, reduced the binding of Met-tRNA(i)(Met) and mRNA to 40S subunits in vitro. Interestingly, eIF5-CTD bound simultaneously to the eIF4G subunit of the cap-binding complex and the NIP1 subunit of eIF3. These interactions may enhance association of eIF4G with eIF3 to promote mRNA binding to the ribosome.

We propose that eIF5-CTD stimulates binding of Met-tRNA(i)(Met) and mRNA to 40S subunits through interactions with eIF2, eIF3 and eIF4G; however, its most important function is to anchor eIF5 to other components of the 48S complex in a manner required to couple GTP hydrolysis to AUG recognition during the scanning phase of initiation.", "meta": {"pmid": 11331597}}

According to the dose (pressure duration)-response studies on the L-BHGA stereoisomers that produced the Iout, the effective potency of threo-L-BHGA was approximately similar to that of erythro-L-BHGA. The dose (pressure duration)-response curve of quisqualic acid was shifted towards the left direction from those of threo-and erythro-L-BHGA, suggesting that the binding activity of quisqualic acid to the receptors would be stronger than those of the L-BHGA stereoisomers. GABA, glycine and L-homocysteic acid showed an inward current (Iin) on this neurone type, in contrast to the Iout caused by L-BHGA. beta-Alanine and taurine had absolutely no effect. Therefore, no amino acid inhibitory neurotransmitter candidate was found for this neurone type except for L-BHGA.

Female CD-1 (ICR) mice were given a single intraperitoneal administration of AOM (10 mg/kg body weight) and followed by one-week oral exposure of 2% (w/v) DSS in drinking water, and then maintained on the basal diets mixed with or without nimesulide (0.04%, w/w), troglitazone (0.05%, w/w), and bezafibrate (0.05%, w/w) for 14 weeks. The inhibitory effects of dietary administration of these compounds were determined by histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Feeding with nimesulide and troglitazone significantly inhibited both the incidence and multiplicity of colonic adenocarcinoma induced by AOM/DSS in mice. Bezafibrate feeding significantly reduced the incidence of colonic adenocarcinoma, but did not significantly lower the multiplicity. Feeding with nimesulide and troglitazone decreased the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-labeling index and expression of beta-catenin, COX-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine. The treatments increased the apoptosis index in the colonic adenocarcinoma. Feeding with bezafibrate also affected these parameters except for beta-catenin expression in the colonic malignancy.

Currently, the physiological role of BCAS2 in mammals is unknown. We now report that BCAS2 responds to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage in mouse zygotes. Maternal depletion of BCAS2 compromises the DNA damage response in early embryos, leading to developmental arrest at the two- to four-cell stage accompanied by the accumulation of damaged DNA and micronuclei. Furthermore, BCAS2 mutants that are unable to bind RPA1 fail in DNA repair during the zygotic stage. In addition, phosphorylated RPA2 cannot localise to the DNA damage sites in mouse zygotes with disrupted maternal BCAS2.

{"text": "Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) drive an array of non-image-forming (NIF) visual responses including circadian photoentrainment and the pupil light reflex. ipRGCs integrate extrinsic (rod/cone) and intrinsic (melanopsin) photoreceptive signals, but the contribution of cones to ipRGC-dependent responses remains incompletely understood. Given recent data revealing that cone-derived colour signals influence mouse circadian timing and pupil responses in humans, here we set out to investigate the role of colour information in pupil control in mice. We first recorded electrophysiological activity from the pretectal olivary nucleus (PON) of anaesthetised mice with a red-shifted cone population (Opn1mwR) and mice lacking functional cones (Cnga3-/-) or melanopsin (Opn1mwR; Opn4-/-). Using multispectral stimuli to selectively modulate the activity of individual opsin classes, we show that PON cells which receive ipRGC input also exhibit robust S- and/or L-cone opsin-driven activity. This population includes many cells where the two cone opsins drive opponent responses (most commonly excitatory/ON responses to S-opsin stimulation and inhibitory/OFF responses to L-opsin stimulation). These cone inputs reliably tracked even slow (0.025\u00a0Hz) changes in illuminance/colour under photopic conditions with melanopsin contributions becoming increasingly dominant for higher-contrast/lower temporal frequency stimuli. We also evaluated consensual pupil responses in awake animals and show that, surprisingly, this aspect of physiology is insensitive to chromatic signals originating with cones. Instead, by contrast with the situation in humans, signals from melanopsin and both cone opsins combine in a purely additive manner to drive pupil constriction in mice. Our data reveal a key difference in the sensory control of the mouse pupil relative to another major target of ipRGCs-the circadian clock. Whereas the latter uses colour information to help estimate time of day, the mouse pupil instead sums signals across cone opsin classes to provide broadband spectral sensitivity to changes in illumination. As such, while the widespread co-occurrence of chromatic responses and melanopsin input in the PON supports a close association between colour discrimination mechanisms and NIF visual processing, our data suggest that colour opponent PON cells in the mouse contribute to functions other than pupil control.", "meta": {"pmid": 30064443}}

The primary end point was the time to new-onset AF adjudicated by 12-lead electrocardiogram at a core laboratory reading center. Secondary outcomes were the correlates of new-onset AF with nonfatal nonhemorrhagic stroke and a combined end point of AS-related events. During the course of the study, new-onset AF was detected in 85 (6%) patients (14.2/1,000 person-years of follow-up). At baseline, patients who developed AF were, compared with those remaining in sinus rhythm, older and had a higher left ventricular mass index a smaller aortic valve area index. Treatment with simvastatin and ezetimibe was not associated with less new-onset AF (odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.57-1.97], P = .717). In contrast, age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07 [95% CI 1.05-1.10], P < .001) and left ventricular mass index (HR 1.01 [95% CI 1.01-1.02], P < .001) were independent predictors of new-onset AF. The occurrence of new-onset AF was independently associated with 2-fold higher risk of AS-related outcomes (HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.02-2.66], P = .04) and 4-fold higher risk of nonfatal nonhemorrhagic stroke (HR 4.04 [95% CI 1.18-13.82], P = .03). Simvastatin and ezetimibe were not associated with less new-onset AF. Older age and greater left ventricular mass index were independent predictors of AF development.

DOTA-NHS-ester was practiced and successively purified by molecular filtration. The chelate:mAb ratio was determined by spectrophotometry. DOTA-PR81 was radiolabeled with In-111 and its radiochemical yield, in vitro stability, in vitro internalization, and immunoreactivity tests were performed. SPECT imaging and tissue counting were applied to evaluate the tissue distribution of [111 In]In-DOTA-hIgG and [111 In]In-DOTA-PR81 in BALB/c mice bearing breast tumors. The radiochemical yield of [111 In]In-DOTA-PR81 complex was >95.0 \u00b1 0.5% (ITLC), and the specific activity was 170 \u00b1 44 MBq/mg. Conjugation reaction resulted in the average number of chelators attached to a mAb (c/a) of 3.4 \u00b1 0.3:1. The radioimmunoconjugate showed immunoreactivity towards MCF7 cell line and MUC1 antigen while its significant in vitro and in vivo stability were investigated over 48 h, respectively (93.0 \u00b1 1.2% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 84.0 \u00b1 1.3% in human serum). The peak concentration of internalized activity of [111 In]In-DOTA-PR81 was between 4 to 6 h.

{"text": "Cattleyak are the Fl hybrids between (\u2640) yak (Bos grunniens) and (\u2642) cattle (Bos taurus). Cattleyak exhibit higher capability in adaptability to a harsh environment and display much higher performances in production than the yak and cattle. The cattleyak, however, are females fertile but males sterile. All previous studies greatly focused on testes tissues to study the mechanism of male infer-tility in cattleyak. However, so far, no transcriptomic study has been conducted on the epididymides of yak and cattleyak. Our objective was to perform comparative transcriptome analysis between the epididymides of yak and cattleyak and predict the etiology of male infertility in cattleyak.Methods: We performed comparative transcriptome profiles analysis by mRNA sequencing in the epidi-dymides of yak and cattleyak. In total 3008 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in cattleyak, out of which 1645 DEGs were up-regulated and 1363 DEGs were down-regulated. Thirteen DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. DEGs included certain genes that were associated with spermatozoal matura-tion, motility, male fertility, water and ion channels, and beta-defensins. LCN9, SPINT4, CES5A, CD52, CST11, SERPINA1, CTSK, FABP4, CCR5, GRIA2, ENTPD3, LOC523530 and DEFB129, DEFB128, DEFB127, DEFB126, DEFB124, DEFB122A, DEFB122, DEFB119 were all downregu-lated, whereas NRIP1 and TMEM212 among top 30 DEGs were upregulated. Furthermore, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway was ranked at top-listed three significantly enriched KEGG pathways that as a consequence of abnormal expression of ER-associated genes in the entire ER protein processing pathway might have been disrupted in male cattleyak which resulted in the down-regulation of several important genes. All the DEGs enriched in this pathway were downregulated ex-cept NEF. Taken together, our findings revealed that there were marked differences in the epididymal transcriptomic profiles of yak and cattleyak. The DEGs were involved in spermatozoal maturation, mo-tility, male fertility, water and ion channels, and beta-defensins. Abnormal expression of ER-associated genes in the entire ER protein processing pathway may have disrupted protein processing pathway in male cattleyak resulting in the downregulation of several important genes involved in sperm maturation, motility and defense.", "meta": {"pmid": 32030088}}
{"text": "Neuron migration is a hallmark of nervous system development that allows gathering of neurons from different origins for assembling of functional neuronal circuits. Cortical inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially forming three transient migratory streams in the cortex before reaching the final laminar destination. Although migration defects lead to the disruption of inhibitory circuits and are linked to aspects of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the molecular mechanisms controlling cortical interneuron development and final layer positioning are incompletely understood. Here, we show that mouse embryos with a double deletion of FLRT2 and FLRT3 genes encoding cell adhesion molecules exhibit an abnormal distribution of interneurons within the streams during development, which in turn, affect the layering of somatostatin+ interneurons postnatally. Mechanistically, FLRT2 and FLRT3 proteins act in a noncell-autonomous manner, possibly through a repulsive mechanism. In support of such a conclusion, double knockouts deficient in the repulsive receptors for FLRTs, Unc5B and Unc5D, also display interneuron defects during development, similar to the FLRT2/FLRT3 mutants. Moreover, FLRT proteins are chemorepellent ligands for developing interneurons in vitro, an effect that is in part dependent on FLRT-Unc5 interaction. Together, we propose that FLRTs act through Unc5 receptors to control cortical interneuron distribution in a mechanism that involves cell repulsion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Disruption of inhibitory cortical circuits is responsible for some aspects of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. These defects include interneuron migration during development. A crucial step during this process is the formation of three transient migratory streams within the developing cortex that determine the timing of interneuron final positioning and the formation of functional cortical circuits in the adult. We report that FLRT proteins are required for the proper distribution of interneurons within the cortical migratory streams and for the final laminar allocation in the postnatal cortex. These results expand the multifunctional role of FLRTs during nervous system development in addition to the role of FLRTs in axon guidance and the migration of excitatory cortical neurons.", "meta": {"pmid": 34301831}}

The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 77, Streptococcus pneumoniae 103, Haemophilus influenzae 95, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. Of 77 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (MPIPC) [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) was 43 strains (55.8%). Against MSSA, imipenem (IPM) and minocycline (MINO) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. Although clindamycin (CLDM) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. Cefotiam (CTM) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. Against MRSA, vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. In contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (CCL), erythromycin (EM), CLDM, and tetracycline (TC) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. Against H. influenzae, LVFX showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was good and its MIC90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) were the most potent against K. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of MIC90. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8% of all the patients, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: Control rats treated with saline (Group I), rats subjected to CIA induction by intradermal injection of bovine collagen II type at the tail (Group II), and rats subjected to CIA and supplemented with either 20 or 40 mg/kg of SB for 28 days (group III or IV). RESULTS Paw swelling, edema, arthritis score, thymus and spleen indexes, and neutrophil infiltration were significantly decreased (p<0.01) by treatment with 20 or 40 mg/kg of SB. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, -6, and -17, and TNF-\u03b1) and anti-collagen II-specific immunoglobulins (IgG1 and IgG2a) were markedly decreased (p<0.01), and those of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH) were significantly increased (p<0.01) in SB-treated rats.

Furthermore, the targets from network pharmacology and metabolism pathways were jointly analyzed. Finally, the activities of key metabolic enzymes were experimentally validated by ELISA. Metabolic profiling indicated that the metabolic disturbance in plasma was markedly alleviated after treatment. Nine putative biomarkers mainly involving in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and tyrosine metabolism were identified. Moreover, the compound-target-pathway network of RR and CF for CKD treatment was constructed by network pharmacology, which was related to tyrosine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism. The results were partly consistent with the findings of plasma metabolomics. In conclusion, this study solidly supported and enhanced current understanding of the synergy effects of RR and CF on CKD.

{"text": "High risk of embolic events exists in both patients with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and patients in the perioperative period of ablation (effective treatment for AF). Therefore, anticoagulant therapy is important. Oral anticoagulants can be divided into two major categories: vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). VKAs, represented by warfarin, have been widely used as traditional anticoagulants, whereas NOACs have been used in clinical practice, but their anticoagulant effects and side effects are still the focus of research. We used a meta-analysis to compare the incidence of left atrial thrombi (LAT) between different anticoagulants. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases for observational studies that compared the transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) findings for patients treated with NOACs and VKAs. The incidence of LAT and dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (dense SEC) were extracted as the basis of the meta-analysis. Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. We found that patients anticoagulated with NOACs and VKAs had similar incidence of LAT (OR\u2009=\u20090.74, 95%CI: 0.55-1.00).

{"text": "To investigate the impact of anemia correction with erythropoiesis stimulants on the serum level of the circulating morphogenetic protein \u03b1-Klotho in patients with Stages 3B--4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). 64 patients aged 42\u00b18 years with Stages 3B--4 nondiabetic CKD were examined and divided into 2 groups: 1) 32 patients with anemia (the target hemoglobin levels could be achieved and kept with erythropoietin and iron saccharate in 20 patients (Group A) and those could not be done in 12 patients (Group 1B). A control group (Group 2) consisted of 32 non-anemic patients matched for gender, age, and degree of a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction. Along with iron exchange indicators, the time course of changes in serum Klotho levels were examined in all the 64 patients during screening and one year after the end of the study. For correction of anemia, 32 patients with this condition (Groups 1A and 1B) took short-acting epoetin (hypodermic recormon 2,000 IU thrice per week + iron (intravenous venofer 5 ml of 100 mg once per week)) under control of hemoglobin levels and serum transferrin iron and ferritin saturation. After achieving the target hemoglobin level of 110-120 g/l, for its keeping, all the patients received, instead of short-acting epoetin, long-acting hypodermic darbepoetin-\u03b1 1.5 \u00b5g once every 2 months and intravenous iron saccharate 100 mg once every 2 weeks. Among the 32 anemic patients in Group 1, 20 (63%) (Group 1 A) could achieve the target hemoglobin level (110--120 g/l) and maintain it within this range, by performing therapy with epoitin-\u03b2 + iron saccharate; anemia (the hemoglobin level of <110 g/l) persisted in 12 (37%) patients (Group 1B) despite the fact that epoetin and iron saccharate had been administered. Group 1A was noted to have an increase in \u03b1-Klotho concentrations by an average of 100\u00b111.6-pg/ml as compared to Group 1B (by only 72\u00b14.2 pg/ml). At the same time, the \u03b1-Klotho levels in the control group by the end of the follow-up decreased by an average of 210\u00b112.9 pg/ml as compared to the prescreening value. There was a direct correlation between hemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations and iron ferritin saturation percentage and \u03b1-Klotho levels. It was ascertained that the hemoglobin concentration of \u2265110 g/l with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 75% could predict higher serum \u03b1-Klotho levels in CKD. The same patients were found to have an inverse relationship between the serum level of \u03b1-Klotho and the risk of cardiovascular events. The serum level of the protein Klotho is not only a marker for the severity of CKD and its complications (anemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure), but also a pathogenetic factor of CKD progression. Anemia correction with erythropoiesis stimulants has been shown to enhance the renal and extrarenal production of \u03b1-Klotho.", "meta": {"pmid": 27296257}}
{"text": "Recent genome-wide association studies have identified multiple novel loci associated with obesity in Europeans. We hypothesized that these genetic variants may be associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese. We examined 14 associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 12 loci (NEGR1, SEC16B, TMEM18, ETV5/DGKG, GNPDA2, LIN7C/BDNF, MTCH2, BCDIN3D/FAIM2, SH2B1, FTO, MC4R, and KCTD15) in 605 healthy adults, 1087 healthy adolescents and 6013 T2D patients from Hong Kong. The European at-risk alleles at five loci including GNPDA2, BCDIN3D/FAIM2, SH2B1, FTO, and KCTD15 were significantly associated with increased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (4.5 x 10(-8) < P < 0.024), and/or obesity risk (odds ratio 1.14-1.22, 2.0 x 10(-5) < P < 0.002) in our Chinese populations. The former four loci as well as LIN7C/BDNF were also modestly associated with T2D risk (odds ratio 1.09-1.22, 0.008 < P < 0.041), but the associations were lost after adjustment for BMI, suggesting their roles in T2D risk are mediated through modulation of adiposity. Joint effect analyses of the five adiposity loci revealed an increase of about 0.29 kg/m(2) in BMI with each additional copy of at-risk allele (P(trend) = 4.2 x 10(-12)). Our findings support the important contribution of GNPDA2, BCDIN3D/FAIM2, SH2B1, FTO, and KCTD15 in the regulation of adiposity, which in turn affects T2D risk in Chinese.", "meta": {"pmid": 20215397}}
{"text": "In the present study, we examined the therapeutic potential of human amnion-derived insulin-secreting cells for type 1 diabetes. Human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMs) were isolated from amnion and cultivated to differentiate into insulin-secreting cells in vitro. After culture  in vitro, the differentiated cells (hAM-ISCs) were intensively stained with dithizone and secreted insulin and c-peptide in a high-glucose-dependent manner. They expressed mRNAs of pancreatic cell-related genes, including INS, PDX1, Nkx6-1, NEUROG3, ISL1, NEUROD1, GLUT1, GLUT2, PC1/3, PC2,  GCK, PPY, SST, and GC, and were positive for human insulin and c-peptide. Transplantation of hAM-ISCs into the kidneys of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes restored body weight and normalized the blood glucose levels, which lasted for 210 days. Only human insulin and c-peptide were  detected in the blood of normalized mice after 2 months of transplantation, but little mouse insulin and c-peptide. Removal of graft-bearing kidneys from these mice resulted in causing hyperglycemia again. Human cell-specific gene, hAlu, and human pancreatic cell-specific genes, insulin, PDX1,  GLUT1, GLP1R, Nkx6-1, NEUROD1, and NEUROG3, were detected in the graft-bearing kidneys. Colocalization of human insulin and human nuclei antigen was also observed. These results demonstrate that hAMs could differentiate into functional insulin-secreting cells in vitro, and human insulin secreted  from hAM-ISCs following transplantation into type 1 diabetic mice could normalize hyperglycemia, overcoming immune rejection for a long period.", "meta": {"pmid": 22490341}}
{"text": "In 2004, wheat flour fortification (WFF) with iron was implemented in Kazakhstan as a public health strategy to increase the iron intake of all women of childbearing age and of children. In 2003, before starting the flour fortification program, a communication campaign on health education took place in a region with a high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency and IDA before and after the campaign. In addition, knowledge about IDA and its prevention, as well as awareness about fortified wheat flour, was assessed. The subjects of the study were women aged 15-49 years and children aged 2-14 years. The study was carried out in urban and rural areas of Kyzyl-Orda region in 2003 before (March) and after (December) the campaign. Blood samples were collected in order to measure hemoglobin and serum ferritin. In March 80 women and 57 children in the urban area, and 41 women and 41 children in the rural area, participated in the IDA testing. The corresponding participants in December numbered 62, 52, 52, and 57, respectively. The impacts of the communications and information received by participants during the campaign was surveyed with a questionnaire for 195 women in March and 198 women in December including some who participated in the IDA testing. In March, the prevalence of anemia was 52.0% among 121 women and 58.1% among 98 children, and those with low iron reserve were 63.6%, 49.1% and IDA 40.5%, 11.0%, respectively. In December, the prevalence of anemia had significantly decreased among rural women (from 65.9% to 48.0%, p < 0.05) and among urban children (from 63.1% to 11.5%, p < 0.001). The prevalence of iron deficiency was significantly reduced among the children (from 51.1% to 24.8%, p < 0.001). IDA prevalence was meaningfully decreased among women in urban and combined areas (from 37.5% to 15.0% and 40.5 to 14.8%, respectively, p < 0.001) and among urban children (from 7.1% to 2.1%, p < 0.05). The surveys found that most women knew about IDA and its prevention and that the numbers were similar both in March and in December. The knowledge of the anti-anemic effect of wheat fortified flour improved significantly over the period of the campaign among women both in urban (from 48.5% to 80.9%, p < 0.001) and rural (from 69.8% to 88.6%, p < 0.001) areas. The study demonstrated that the communication campaign before implementation of WFF program was effectively carried out, giving a biological impact on hematological indices.", "meta": {"pmid": 20236546}}
{"text": "Cisapride is a prokinetic agent which restores motility of the gastrointestinal tract in conditions of decreased bowel transit. It may also alter the absorption of coadministered drugs. The absorption of morphine, diazepam, cyclosporin, alcohol (ethanol) and levodopa are increased. Initial absorption of cimetidine and raniditine is also increased, but overall absorption is lower due to increased bowel transit. The absorption of digoxin, propranolol and the anticoagulants warfarin and phenprocoumon appears unaffected by cisapride, although increase thrombotest values were seen with acenocoumarol (nicoumalone). Drug interactions leading to increased plasma concentrations of cisapride may produce an increase in adverse effects. The most important of these is QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Phenytoin does not appear to affect protein binding of cisapride. Cisapride metabolism is inhibited by the antifungals ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and miconazole, and by the antibacterials erythromycin, troleandomycin and clarithromycin. Cisapride should not be coadministered with these drugs. Cimetidine produces a small increase in cisapride plasma concentrations, which may be due to inhibition of metabolism. Cisapride absorption is unaffected by other antacids. Atropine may reverse the cisapride-induced increase in peristalsis. Prescribers should remain vigilant to the presence of these and other, as yet unreported, reactions.", "meta": {"pmid": 8879971}}
{"text": "Alkyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be metabolized to highly reactive benzylic sulfuric acid esters via benzylic hydroxylation and subsequent sulfonation. We have studied the benzylic hydroxylation of 1-methylpyrene (MP), a hepatocarcinogen in rodents, and 1-ethylpyrene (EP), whose benzylic hydroxylation would produce a secondary alcohol (alpha-HEP), in contrast to the primary alcohol (alpha-HMP) formed from MP. The hydrocarbons were incubated with hepatic microsomal preparations from humans and rats, as well as with V79-derived cell lines engineered for the expression of individual cytochrome P450 (CYP) forms from human (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2E1, 3A4) and rat (1A1, 1A2, 2B1). All microsomal systems and CYP-expressing cell lines used, but not CYP-deficient V79 cells, showed biotransformation of both hydrocarbons. Formation of the benzylic alcohol was detected in each case. alpha-HMP and its oxidation product, 1-pyrenylcarboxylic acid (COOH-P), accounted for a major part of the total amount of the metabolites formed from MP in the presence of human liver microsomes (38-64%) and cells expressing human 3A4, 2E1 or 1B1 (80-85%). Likewise, cells expressing human 1A1 showed a higher contribution of alpha-HMP and COOH-P to the total metabolites (45%) than cells expressing the orthologous enzyme of the rat (3%). EP was metabolized at a higher rate and with modified regioselectivity compared with MP, although omega-hydroxylation of the side chain was not detected with the cell lines and only accounted for a small percent of the biotransformation by the microsomal preparations. The highest contributions of alpha-HEP to the total metabolites from EP were detected with the cells expressing human 1A1, 1B1 and 3A4 (38-51%). alpha-HEP accounted for 16% of the metabolites formed in the presence of human hepatic microsomes. Thus, benzylic hydroxylation is a major initial step in the metabolism of MP and EP. This pathway appears to be even more important in humans than in rats. Previously, we had shown that the second step of the activation, the sulfonation of alpha-HMP and alpha-HEP, is also efficiently catalysed by various forms of human sulfotransferases.", "meta": {"pmid": 10469624}}
